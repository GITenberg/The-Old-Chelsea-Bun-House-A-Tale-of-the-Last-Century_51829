<h3><i>Lady Betty's Folly.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a sad Thing when a Lady of
Quality, who has been a Toast in her
Youth, and has seen the white-gloved
Beaux, as Mr. <i>Pope</i> calls them, bowing
to her from the Pit, and kissing the scented
Tips of their Gloves to her in the Ring;
who has flaunted at <i>Vauxhall</i>, and shone
in a Side-Box of the Opera-House in
<i>Lincoln's Inn Fields</i>; has run down <i>Handel</i>,
and run after <i>Bononcini</i>; has had her gay
Water-Parties to <i>Jenny's Whim</i>, attended
by Violins and Hautboys; and has brought,
not only her own Company, but her own
Strawberries and Cherries to our Bun-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as if our own were not good enough;
it is mortifying, I say, when such a Lady
of Quality falls into the sear and yellow
Autumn of Life, and finds herself a disregarded
Thing, with no resources but
green Tea and Brag. And such is the
Case with poor Lady <i>Betty Spadille</i>.</p>

<p>How well I remember her, on the
Occasion I have somewhat maliciously
alluded to, for it sticks in my Throat,
arriving at our Bun-House in her peach-coloured
Sacque, Mechlin Head, and red-heeled
Shoes, the Foreparts richly embroidered
with Silver; loudly talking and
laughing, and turning her Head right and
left, now to this Beau, now to t'other,
who fluttered round her with their clouded
Canes and perfumed Wigs; now bursting
into what the <i>French</i> People call <i>des
grands Eclats de Rire</i>, now flirting her Fan,
or rapping it on the Shoulder of one of
the Ladies who accompanied her. Having
just set my Mark, a Sprig of Rosemary, in
the midst of one of good Bishop <i>Atterbury</i>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Sermons, I thought within myself, "Is this
a Creature that is formed for Eternity?"
Meanwhile, two tall Lacqueys, with immense
Shoulder-Knots, bore between them
a great Hamper of <i>French</i> Wine; while
a little black Page, in pale Blue, laced
with Silver, tottered under the Fruit from
<i>Rogers's</i>; and certainly it was very fine.
I never saw such Strawberries and Cherries
before nor since.</p>

<p>I did not think her a Belle of the first
Order, setting her Rank and Style aside.
Her Shape was fine; her Hand and Foot
delicately formed; but she rolled her Eyes
too much, and had too high a Colour. I
don't believe she painted. Altogether,
she seemed in the very Flush of Existence;
as if she had never met with a Reverse,
nor ever expected one. She seemed to
think "Let us Eat and Drink," without
adding, "To-morrow <i>we die</i>."</p>

<p>We had set our oval Walnut-wood
Table under the umbrageous Shade of two
large Elms, and had spread it with one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
our best Tablecloths. This was superciliously
removed by the two Footmen,
who spread a Tablecloth and Napkins
they had brought with them. Our China
Service and water Caraffes they condescended
to use. Meanwhile, the Boatmen
brought up a second Hamper, containing
Ham, Tongue, Chicken, Sallet,
and other Matters: but the Footmen, I
should mention, brought the Plate, including
not only silver Forks, but a silver
Stew-Pan.</p>

<p>The gay Bevy having streamed hither
and thither, making their humorous and
contemptuous Remarks, which were continually
interspersed with, "Oh, my <i>Lord</i>!"
and, "Oh, Sir <i>Charles</i>!" at length settled
down to their Repast. There were three
Ladies and four Gentlemen. Also, there
was a tall, slender Girl in Black, whom
I concluded my <i>Lady's</i> own Woman, because
she stood the whole Time, a little
behind Lady <i>Betty</i>, holding her Handkerchief
and Scent-Bottle, watching her Eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and obeying her Commands, almost before
spoken; notwithstanding which, my <i>Lady's</i>
Lip was often put up, and such words as
"Thou'rt strangely slow ... Canst not
hear me, Creature?" were muttered by
her rosy mouth.</p>

<p>And there was pale Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, sitting
at his open Casement over the Bun-Shop,
Book in Hand, hearing, seeing, and silently
noting all.</p>

<p>One of the Gentlemen was my Lord
<i>Earlstoke</i>, (to whom the Town gave Lady
<i>Betty</i>,) a weak-eyed, puny Peer; another,
Sir <i>Charles Sefton</i>, all Fashion and Froth;
a third, a handsome young Gentleman,
whom they called Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>: the
fourth, who had the Wit and Sprightliness
of all the Rest, (for whereas they continually
laughed, he continually gave
them Something worth laughing at,) was
a lank, ungraceful, undersized Personage,
of olivander Complexion, with projecting
Teeth, quick, black Eyes, and a not unagreeable
Physiognomy, though his Figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was mean and almost Distorted. His
Name was <i>Caryl</i>, which I learned not
at first, they were so given to address him
by his baptismal Name of <i>Paul</i>.</p>

<p>Then, for the Ladies, there was Lady
<i>Mary</i>, my <i>Lord's</i> Aunt, and the Duenna
of the Party; and Lady <i>Grace</i>, a sweet
pretty Creature, but empty and self-sufficient.</p>

<p>It might have been thought, that two
able-bodied Men and a Foot-page were
Servitors enow for a Party of seven; but
on the contrary, they kept my younger
Sister <i>Prudence</i>, who was then very pretty,
continually afoot, tripping to and from the
House on one impertinent errand or another,
while I attended to the general Customers.
At length, coming up to me
with a painful Blush on her Cheek,
"<i>Patty</i>," says she, "do oblige me by
changing Places, will you? I can't abide
the ways of these Quality, and give no
satisfaction, and only get scoffed at."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may please them no better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<i>Prue</i>," said I, "however, I'll try." And
as I proceeded to take her Place, I heard
Mr. <i>Paul</i> (that's to say, Mr. <i>Caryl</i>,)
observe to Sir <i>Charles</i>, "Humph! we've
lost <i>Rachel</i> and got <i>Leah</i>."</p>

<p>This was not over-civil; but I took no
notice.</p>

<p>"Now then," cries Lady <i>Betty</i>, in high
Good-Humour, "I'll make you what we
have called a <i>Petersham</i> Chicken, ever
since Lady <i>Caroline's</i> Frolick. Here are
seven of us, and here are seven Chickens,
which must, in the first Place, be finely
minced; so let each take one." And
while every one was laughing and mincing
their Chicken, she pulls off ever so
many diamond Rings from her white Fingers,
and gives them to her Woman to
hold.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself, my <i>Lord</i>,"
says she, carelessly, as he stoops to pick up
one she had let fall on the Grass, "<i>Gatty</i>
will find it. Here, Child, take them all;
and," (aside with a Frown), "be sure you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
don't lose them. Now, <i>Pompey</i>! the spirit-Lamp;
three pats of Butter, and a Flaggon
of spring Water. The only variation I
make in Lady <i>Caroline's</i> cookery is to stew
my Chicken in a silver Stew-Pan, instead
of in a China Dish, which might crack
over the Lamp. Prithee, <i>Pompey</i>, don't
let the Grass grow under your Feet!"</p>

<p>Methought, if her Ladyship had been
<i>obliged</i> to cook her own Supper, she would
have considered herself demeaned by it
very much: however, there is nothing
that Quality will not do for a Freak. By
and by, she gets tired of stewing her
Chicken over the Lamp, and bids the
young Person she calls <i>Gatty</i> to carry it
in-doors and dress it over the Fire. "And
be sure, Child, not to let it burn." As I
did not seem wanted, I shewed Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>
the way to the Kitchen, and stood by
while she stirred the Stew-Pan over the
Fire. "I'm ready to drop!" says she, at
length. "No wonder," said I, taking the
silver Spoon from her, and using it myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"you have never once sat down since you
left the Boat, and 'tis the Dog-Days.
Rest awhile, and I'll mind the Chicken."
"Thank you heartily," says she, dropping
into a Seat, and turning from Red to
White, and then Red again. "May I take
a draught of this cold Water?" "Aye,
and welcome," said I, "so that you're not
afraid of drinking it while you're so hot."
"Oh, I'm not afraid," says she, drinking
plentifully of it, and setting down the Mug
with a Sigh of relief. "I'm better now,
but there was such a glare upon the River."
"Are you her Ladyship's Woman?" said
I. With that, she fetches a deep Sigh;
and, says she, "I'm no better, now, and a
hard Life to me it is. I am the Daughter
of a poor Country Curate, who died and
left a large Family penniless: but my
<i>Mother</i>, who married him for love,
had high Connections; so Lady <i>Betty</i>
takes me for her Woman, partly, as
she says, out of Charity, and partly
because she prefers being served by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
decayed Person of Condition. I have
twenty Pounds by the Year, and indeed
'tis hardly earned." "That I can well
believe," said I. "But what can I do?"
says she. "My <i>Lady</i> has engaged to
give me enough cast-off Apparel, to keep
me in Clothing; so that I shall be able to
send the twenty Pounds to my <i>Mother</i>."
"There'll be some comfort to you in doing
that," said I. "The greatest of comforts,"
says she; "and 'tis that which keeps me
up, in spite of hard Work, late Hours,
and contumely; for no one has a better
and dearer Mother than I have." "Well,
the Chicken is done now," said I. "Shall
I carry it out for you?" "Oh no, I dare
not remain behind," says <i>Gatty</i>; "but
do you come along with me, for you will
make me feel less lonely." So I went
with her according to her wish; and when
we came up to the Table, we found Lady
<i>Betty</i> talking about her foreign Travels;
for, it seemed she had been abroad with
my <i>Lord</i> her <i>Father</i>, on some public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Mission or Ambassade, to this and the
other distant Land, that had formerly been
the Seat of War. And, to my Fancy, she
discoursed agreeably enough of <i>Belgrade</i>,
<i>Peterwaradin</i>, and <i>Prince Eugene</i>,
though my Lord did not seem to think so;
for, once, he covered his Mouth with his
Hand to conceal a Yawn, not so adroitly
but that my Lady perceived it; and thereupon
she immediately diverted her Conversation
to Sir <i>Charles</i>, and never spoke to
his <i>Lordship</i> another Word. The <i>Petersham</i>
Chicken was too Gross, as 'twas like
to be, with that monstrous quantity of
Butter: my Lady <i>Betty</i> was annoyed, and
said Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> had oiled it over the Fire,
darting at her a side-look of Reproach.
It was sent away, and the Fruit set upon
Table; and the Black Boy, producing a
Theorbo, sang foreign Airs while they
finished their Repast. A brisk encounter
of Wits then ensuing between Mr. <i>Caryl</i>,
Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>, and Sir <i>Charles</i>, my <i>Lady</i>
presently found herself cut out; notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she made one or two ineffectual
efforts to recover the lead; and extremely
mortified that she should, even for a few
Minutes, be Second, she threw herself
back in her Chair, called for Essences, and
bade Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> support her to the House;
protesting she had the Vapours to that
degree, that nothing but Seclusion and
Repose could restore her sufficiently to
enable her to take Boat. The other two
Ladies, constrained to follow her, made
wry Faces to one another behind her Back,
but accompanied her in-doors, leaving the
Gentlemen to saunter about, or sit over
their Wine. Having entered our little
Parlour and made a prodigious fuss, till we
were all in waiting on her, "How horridly
vapourish I feel!" cries she; "But
what! Is that some real Dragon China
on the Mantel-Shelf? How did you
come by it, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>?"</p>

<p>I coldly replied, "My <i>Father</i> bought
it, <i>Madam</i>."</p>

<p>"And, those Josses and Mandarins,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pursues she, "have positively the appearance
of being, nay, they <i>are</i> genuine!
What lovely <i>Chelsea</i> China! These
Shepherdesses fondling Lambs and Kids
are nearly equal to mine. Sure, can
a Person of your <i>Father's</i> Condition,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, afford to be a Virtuoso?"</p>

<p>"Had my <i>Husband</i> not been a Virtuoso,
<i>Madam</i>," says my <i>Mother</i>, quietly looking
up from making an <i>Hippocrates'</i> sleeve
for our Jelly, "these Girls had never
needed to keep a Bun-House." Which
indeed, was true enough, for my <i>Father</i>,
who had been apprenticed to the first
Jeweller in <i>London</i>, might have commanded
a flourishing Business, and accumulated a
Fortune, but for his unhappy Taste for
Articles of Virtu, which led him into connection
with unprincipled Men of Quality,
who ran in his Debt, and would have run
him through if he had dunned 'em; and
that again led to his drowning Trouble in
Intemperance. So that, had not a Legacy,
opportunely left to my dear <i>Mother</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her sole and separate use, enabled her to
purchase our present House and Business,
for <i>Prudence</i> and me, 'twould have
fared ill with her and with us, and with
my poor <i>Father</i> too. And hitherto, we
had gone on so steadily and respectably,
that we had given general Satisfaction,
and notwithstanding our unprotected State
(for my poor <i>Father</i> was almost worse than
no Protection,) had kept good Names,
and met with no Let nor Hindrance.</p>

<p>Lady <i>Betty</i>, without vouchsafing more
than a Stare at the Speaker of the Words
just addressed to her, turns her Head
slowly round towards me, and with more
Haughtiness than I can describe, "Prithee,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>," says she, "is that good
Woman your <i>Mother</i>?"</p>

<p>Now certainly, to be a good Woman
is the chief Merit of our Sex; and to have
it acknowledged that one whom we dearly
love and reverence is such, ought to be
taken as a compliment, rather than the
other way: but yet I knew full well that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Lady <i>Betty</i> had not used this term respectfully
and kindly, but quite the reverse;
wherefore I replied, "Yes, <i>Madam</i>," very
bluntly.</p>

<p>"How are the Men amusing themselves?"
says she to Lady <i>Grace</i>, who
was looking out of the Window.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Caryl</i> seems reading them a copy
of Verses which diverts them hugely,"
said Lady <i>Grace</i>.</p>

<p>"Odious Creature!" cried Lady <i>Betty</i>,
forgetting all her Languor, and fanning
herself vehemently, "A Man of Letters
is the very worst possible Ingredient in
a Party of Pleasure; he thinks of Nothing
but shewing himself off. I'll never
invite another to a Folly. Sure 'tis Time
for us now to think of returning."</p>

<p>"Were we not to wait for the Moon?"
says Lady <i>Grace</i>.</p>

<p>"If you particularly wish it, we will
do so," says Lady <i>Betty</i>, "but I really
believe the evening Air on the Water
will kill me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, then the Moon will be too expensive
a luxury," says Lady <i>Grace</i>, "let
us return at once by all means."</p>

<p>And the Black Boy was instantly sent to
prepare the Gentlemen for the reembarkation.</p>

<p>"Give me my Cardinal, Child," says
Lady <i>Betty</i> to <i>Gatty</i>. "Why, what on
Earth is the matter with your Hands?
They are covered with a Rash. Your
Face, too, is as red as this Velvet.
Huh! don't come near me! Stay, let
me rush into the open Air. You are sickening
with some infectious Complaint."</p>

<p>Poor <i>Gatty</i> stood transfixed and aghast;
Lady <i>Grace</i> gave a little Shriek, and ran
to the door after Lady <i>Betty</i>; while the
elder Lady, less absurdly timorous, stood
at pause, looking at the poor Girl, who
did, indeed, appear very much heated.</p>

<p>"You are really ill, I believe, young
Woman," said she stiffly. "What is to
be done? You cannot go back with
us in the Boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>And following Lady <i>Betty</i>, she held a
Dialogue with her in the open Air.</p>

<p>"She can't come near me; she shan't
come near me," cries Lady <i>Betty</i> vehemently;
and then the three Ladies talked
under their Breath. At length Lady <i>Mary</i>
returned.</p>

<p>"Young Woman," says she; "Dear me,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, you are very incautious, to
hold her Hand that Way, with her Head
resting on your Neck; there's no knowing
what she may communicate."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of her communicating
any Harm, Madam," said I.</p>

<p>"I have come to ask you," resumes
Lady <i>Mary</i>, "whether you know of any
decent Lodging, where this young Person
may be placed till her Illness declares
itself one Way or another. I suppose
there must be plenty of People that
would readily take her in."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Madam," said my <i>Mother</i>,
again taking up the Word, "if the
Disorder be, as you seem to suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
infectious, I do not see how we can ask
any of our Neighbours to incur the
Hazard of it; but, for myself, I am so
little fearful of the Consequences, that I
will undertake the Care of Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>, if
Lady <i>Betty</i> wishes it, till, as your <i>Ladyship</i>
says, her Illness declares itself one
Way or another."</p>

<p>"An excellent Plan! extremely well
thought of," says Lady <i>Mary</i>. "Of
course, Lady <i>Betty</i> will remunerate you
handsomely for your Trouble."</p>

<p>"And Risk," put in my <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"And Risk," repeated Lady <i>Mary</i>;
"though, I protest, I think there is none;
but that the young Woman has merely
been overheated, and taken a Chill
upon it."</p>

<p>Though Lady <i>Mary</i> spoke not sincerely,
yet her expressed Opinion was so much like
my <i>Mother's</i> real one, that the Arrangement
was speedily concluded. And then,
after as much Fuss in departing as they
had made in arriving, these heartless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Denizens of the Great World quitted us;
full of themselves, caring very little for
each other, and least of all for the poor
Dependent left sick upon our Hands.</p>

<p>"Thank Goodness they're gone!" exclaimed
<i>Prudence</i>, as the last Rustle of
Silk, and the last empty Laugh was heard.</p>

<p>"And now, where to bestow our young
Charge?" said my <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are to me!" said
<i>Gatty</i>; Tears rolling down her Cheeks.
"Any Place will do."</p>

<p>"I think <i>Prudence</i> must sleep in the
little Closet beyond my Chamber," said
my <i>Mother</i>, "and then, <i>Patty</i>, you can
share your Bed with Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>. You
are not afraid, Child, are you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Afraid, Mother?</i> No!"</p>

<h3><i>Mrs. Patty &amp; Mrs. Gatty.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bed and Night-Clothes were soon
prepared; and as I helped Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> to
undress, I could not help noting, that
though her Gown was of the plainest
black Stuff, her under Garments were
beautifully Fine, and fitted to a Nicety;
which corroborated what she had said of
her being a young Woman of good Condition.
"You must not alarm yourself,
Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>," said I; "you will very
likely be quite well to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Don't call me Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>," says she.
"Call me <i>Gertrude</i>, which is my proper
Name, and it will put me in Mind of
Home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, Mrs. <i>Gertrude</i>," said I.</p>

<p>"Not Mrs. at all, I entreat of you,"
said she, "plain, simple <i>Gertrude</i>."</p>

<p>"Simple <i>Gertrude</i>, you may be," said I,
"but plain <i>Gertrude</i>, you certainly are
not."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, and said, "Ah, you
are very Kind, and mean kindly; but
the finest Compliment in the World is
of little Value to me, compared with
a Word of Kindness: and yours only
pleases me so far as Kindness is expressed
in it. And now, dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, let
down the Curtain, and make the Chamber
as dark as you can, and I will try
to sleep; for my Head aches to Distraction,
and there is Nothing you can
do for me."</p>

<p>When I went down Stairs, I found my
<i>Mother</i> mentioning <i>Gatty's</i> Case to Dr.
<i>Elwes</i>, who frequently stepped in to smoak
a quiet Pipe under our Elms. He immediately
went up Stairs to see her; and
was guarded in pronouncing whether she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had a Fever, a Chill, a Surfeit, or what; but
said Time would disclose, and he would
see her again in the Morning. Meanwhile,
she was to be kept Cool and Quiet;
and he would write a Prescription for a
Composing Draught; which accordingly
he did.</p>

<p>"And now, with respect to Supper,"
said I, when he was gone. "Dear me!
who has thought, all this Time, of Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i>?"</p>

<p>No one had remembered him; so I
immediately carried up his Whey and
Buns, smote to the Heart at his having
been so entirely overlooked. When I
went in, he was still sitting at the Casement.
He said, "Well, <i>Leah</i>!" with a
gentle Smile, which assured me that he
had heard and remembered what had
passed at Lady <i>Betty's</i> Table.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir," said I, "I am quite sorry
you should have been so long forgotten.
We have had such a noisy Party this
Afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather tumultuous certainly," said he;
"they helped to amuse me, and it was
not my Fault that I heard every Word
they said."</p>

<p>"How loudly High-Bred People laugh
and talk, Sir!" said I.</p>

<p>"I doubt if it be High-Breeding to do
so," said he; "Ill-Breeding it seems to
me."</p>

<p>"What did you think, Sir, of Mr.
<i>Caryl</i>? Mr. <i>Paul</i>, as they called him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought he tried to serve the
<i>Petersham</i> Chicken with <i>Walpole</i> Sauce."</p>

<p>"He was very smart and ready, Sir,
wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, he had plenty of
Repartee."</p>

<p>"What is a Repartee, Sir?"</p>

<p>"A smart Reply. When Mr. <i>Pope</i>,
who was deformed, asked a young
Officer if he knew what a Note of
Interrogation was, the other replied, 'A
little crooked Thing that asks Questions.'
That was a Repartee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very ill-natured One, though, Sir.
When Sir <i>Charles</i> said of the unfortunate
Emigrant <i>Lady</i>, 'That Woman
deserves a Crown,' and Mr. <i>Paul</i> rejoined,
that he had not a Crown to lay
at her Feet, but he had Half-a-Crown
very much at her Service: was that a
Repartee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was suggested by the Remark
of the First, and could not have been
prepared. You have culled a Grain of
Wheat, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, from a Bushel of
Chaff."</p>

<p>"You thought Lady <i>Betty</i> a great
Beauty, I suppose, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, she is what is called a Fine-Woman,
I believe. Fine Eyes, and
Teeth; good Carriage of the Head."</p>

<p>"Oh Sir! had you seen her toss that
Head at my poor <i>Mother</i>! 'Twas as
much as I could stand!"</p>

<p>"I am glad, then, that I did not. She
has Wit, however, but is too artificial,
flighty, and exacting. There's a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of Coarseness about her. 'Twas so humorous,
to hear her trying to recover
her Supremacy in that Dialogue among
the Men, when she began once and
again 'When I was at <i>Peterwaradin</i>,'
and no one was listening to her!"</p>

<p>"Except you and me, Sir. Well, I
must not keep you from Supper."</p>

<p>"Nor must I keep you standing. How
are you going to manage about Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i>?"</p>

<p>"She's going to sleep with me, Sir; if
I sleep at all, that is."</p>

<p>"You expect a restless Night."</p>

<p>"I doubt if I shall lie down if she continue
as she is."</p>

<p>"If you are going to sit up, you will
require Something to keep you awake.
Shall I find you a Book to read?"</p>

<p>"Do, if you please, Sir; I shall gratefully
thank you!"</p>

<p>"Well then, what will you have? You
know I have no Novels. Here is a
charming Paper of Mr. <i>Addison's</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
one of the old <i>Spectators</i>, which I was
reading when you came in. '<i>Cheerfulness
preferable to Mirth.</i>' How well it
opens! 'I have always preferred Cheerfulness
to Mirth. The latter I consider
as an Act, the former as a Habit of the
Mind.'"</p>

<p>"That will not take long in reading,
Sir. Might I have one of <i>Shakspeare's</i>
Plays? I liked the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>
so much!"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may. Did you like
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Sir."</p>

<p>"Come, then, here is the <i>Winter's Tale</i>
for you. Or stay, here is <i>Cymbeline</i>.
You will like much of it, though not
all; for you have as nice a Taste in
Books, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, as your <i>Father</i> has
in old China. <i>Imogen</i> is one of the
purest, loveliest Creations of the Poet.
When you get tired of her Companions,
turn the Leaf till you come to her, and
you won't fall asleep. Her two Brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
too, in the Cave, are charming. What
a fine Lesson is given here, in a mere
passing Word of the Physician to the
Queen, against Cruelty to dumb Animals!
She tells him she experimentalizes
with Poisons on Creatures not
worth the hanging; and he tells her she
hardens her Heart, and proceeding from
low degrees to higher, will become
careless of inflicting pain and death on
superior Natures. Here it is, Mrs.
<i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>I took the Book, curtseyed, and withdrew;
thinking that this little Dialogue
with the good young Curate after the
Noise and Babble of Lady <i>Betty's</i> Party,
was like gazing on cool Green, after one's
Eyes had been dazzled by garish Sunshine.
Since he had lodged with us, to drink fresh
Whey and recover his Health, I, being the
elder and plainer Sister of the two, had
principally waited upon him; though I
seldom encroached so much on his Leisure
as on this Evening, which I partly ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on, because I felt I had neglected him
during the Afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> passed a restless Night, and
rambled a good deal, fancying herself at
Home, or what I concluded such; and
talking of, and to her Kinsfolk and
Intimates by name. What with attending
to her and reading my Play-Book, I got
not much Rest; but towards Day-Break,
she became Quiet; so then I had a good
Nap, with my Cloathes loosened, but not
off, and awoke refreshed, just in time to
go and see the Milk and Bread sent out,
which was my daily Duty.</p>

<p>Our's had become a large Concern. At
first, we only sold Bread and Buns to those
who came to the Shop; then we got on to
having two Carts, that went into Town
twice a Week; then Whey was wanted,
and we had a Cow; but the Cow was not
in Milk all the Year round, so then we
had two; and then we kept their Calves,
<i>Prue</i> and I undertaking to bring them up
by Hand; and the pretty Creatures grew so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fond of us, that they would run round the
Meadow after us if we but held out our
Finger to them. In short, our Milk and
Whey became in such repute, that we got
on from two Cows to six, and at length
to Twelve, and had the largest Milk-walk
in the neighbourhood. Our man <i>Andrew</i>,
who was from <i>Devonshire</i>, looked after the
<i>Dairy</i>; and <i>Saunders</i>, who was a <i>Scot</i>, was
our Baker; but a Mistress's Eye is worth
two Pair of Hands; and one Reason of our
Success was undoubtedly that we looked
closely after our Business ourselves, no
matter how much Money was coming
into the Till.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Elwes</i> used to say, that he never
knew better Samples of a genteel Industry
than in our Establishment; but doubtless,
the good <i>Doctor's</i> Judgment was somewhat
biassed by his Partiality for my dear <i>Mother</i>;
whom, I am bold to think, if he had
known her before she was married, and
before he himself had risen from the
Ranks, (if one may say so of a Civilian,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
he would have gladly made his Wife.
What a different Lot for my poor <i>Mother</i>!
But then, the whole Story of our Lives
would have been altered, and the Divine
Purposes quite otherwise manifested; and
my poor <i>Father</i> would have gone down
the Stream, with ne'er a Hand held out to
draw him towards Shore.</p>

<p>Just as I was booking the Loaves put
into the Carts, up rides Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i> on
a mighty fine Horse. He was, as good
Mr. <i>Matthew Henry</i> says of <i>Prince
Adonijah</i>, a pretty, comely young Gentleman;
and he lighted down, and gave his
Bridle to <i>Peter</i>, and stept up to me, to
inquire how fared Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>, saying that
he hoped to make himself welcome to
Lady <i>Betty</i> by carrying good news, therefore
had ridden to <i>Chelsea</i> before Breakfast.
I replied she had had a disturbed Night,
but was then sleeping; on which, having
not much more to say, and seeing me
busied, he went his ways.</p>

<p>Just then, my <i>Mother</i> called over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Stair-Head, in rather an agitated Voice, to
inquire whether my <i>Father</i> had yet got his
Dish of strong green Tea; and knowing
that he had come Home somewhat convivial
in the Middle of the Night, and was
likely to be troubled with Head-Ache,
low Spirits, and Ill-Humours this Morning,
I hastily went into the back Parlour.
But there was dear <i>Prudence</i> already at
her Post, fresh as a Primrose, with the Tea
brewed, and the Table spread with a
tempting variety of Meats, fresh Eggs, and
hot Rolls, not one of which had my poor
<i>Father</i> the Appetite to taste, but sat with
trembling Hands, endeavouring to pour
the Cream into his Tea without spilling
it. On my coming in, he looks up and
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have those Rascals brought the Hamper
yet?"</p>

<p>"What Hamper, <i>Father</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, a Hamper and Packing-Case of
<i>Chelsea</i> China I bought at the Auction-Rooms
yesterday."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, <i>Father</i>, have you been buying
more China?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, Miss <i>Patty</i>, more by
Token, I bought it as a Compliment to
your <i>Mother</i>, and outbade my Lord
<i>Fribble</i>; so what have you to say to that
now?"</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Father</i>, my <i>Mother</i> will feel the
compliment; but, had you let it alone,
'twould have been the greater Kindness."</p>

<p>"That's a Solecism, <i>Patty</i>; but here
comes <i>Peter</i> with the Case; and here comes
your <i>Mother</i> to see it unpacked."</p>

<p>As 'twas no use to cross him about a
Thing that was done, I ran to be my dear
<i>Mother's</i> "live Walking-Stick;" and when
I had settled her in her Easy-Chair, with
all her little Comforts about her, she takes
Breath, and says to my <i>Father</i>, "Good
Morning, my Dear."</p>

<p>"Good Morning, my Dear," replies he;
"this is our Wedding-Day;" and got up,
and kissed her.</p>

<p>This was so unlike his usual Mood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that <i>Prudence</i> and I were surprised and
touched.</p>

<p>"I dare say now," pursues he, "that
you had forgot it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>,&mdash;my Dear, I
mean," says my <i>Mother</i>, wiping her eyes,
"I remembered it before I got out of Bed&mdash;and
the last thing overnight, too. I'd
no Notion your Memory would be so
good, my dear."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "it seems we each
did the other Injustice, this Time&mdash;a good
Thing if we never do so any more. But
I remembered it yesterday, and bought
you a little Trifle, in Token of it."</p>

<p>"I am sure I am much obliged to you, my
Dear," says my <i>Mother</i>. "Pray what is it?"</p>

<p>"You shall see what you shall see&mdash;you
shall see what you shall see," repeats he
very deliberately, proceeding to take the
Silver Paper off sundry little Figures, as
<i>Peter</i> disengaged them from the Straw&mdash;"The
five Senses, my Dear&mdash;the greatest
Bargain I ever knew."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>My poor <i>Mother</i> lifted up her Hands
and Eyes. "At your old Tricks again, Mr.
<i>Honeywood</i>," said she softly.</p>

<p>"Old Tricks!" repeated he, with the
Air of an injured Man; "why, these are
the most exquisite little Gems you ever
saw! A Nobleman could not make a
more delicate Present to his Mistress.&mdash;Look
at this charming little Creature
stroking her Lapdog ... and this high-bred
Toast taking a Pinch of Snuff, this
Lady of Quality sipping Tokay, and this
Opera-belle ready to swoon with Extasy
at <i>Bononcini</i>&mdash;where are your Eyes, my
Dear?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>, you know the
old Saying, 'Please the Eye and plague
the Heart.'"</p>

<p>"Plague my Heart, then!" cries he in
rising Dudgeon, "if you are not the most
hard to please of any Woman alive.
Why, a Peer bade against me!"</p>

<p>"My Dear, I wish the Lot had been
knocked down to him. These are suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Toys for a Personage of that Condition,
but not for us. Why, now, I
venture to say this Set cost you five and
twenty Pounds, at the lowest Figure."</p>

<p>"Five and twenty? You may add
Something to that. Why, Mrs. <i>Honeywood</i>,
you must be a Dolt, to know their
Value no better than that, or else you are
saying so to incense me!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my Dear, I have learnt the
World's Value for such Things but too
well, by having to pay for them so often.
Are these paid for?"</p>

<p>"Confusion, Madam! Do you mean
to doubt my Honour?"</p>

<p>"Why really, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>, you have
so little ready Money except what is
earned by these poor Girls, that I might
be excused for asking. And in Truth
I do not feel it so much of a Compliment
as I could wish, to have Presents bought
to gratify your own Taste, which you
know do not suit mine, and after all, be
obliged to pay the Bill."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Language I will stand from no
Woman."</p>

<p>"Nay, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>, just look at those
Shepherdesses on the Mantel-Shelf, and
say if it were not so with them...."
... (Smash went the Shepherdesses.)</p>

<p>"The Senses shall go next," cried he,
"if you say another Word! Don't cling
to me, <i>Patty</i>! They shall."</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Father</i>, my <i>Mother</i> is not going
to say another Word. Pray be calm."</p>

<p>"I protest..." begins my <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Mother</i>, pray don't&mdash;<i>Father!</i>
<i>Father!</i> Pray withdraw&mdash;as a Favour!"</p>

<p>"What! be turned out of the Room
like a chidden Child? Your <i>Father</i>,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>? I'll sit here till Dinner,
I vow. <i>Prue</i>, fetch me the Daily
Courant, and a clean Pipe."</p>

<p>"It has not come in yet, <i>Father</i>."</p>

<p>"Hang it! everything is out of joint!
I shall go to the <i>Trumpet</i>, in <i>Sheer Lane</i>,
and you won't hear of me again, any of
you, for a good While."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prue</i> and I tried to stay him, but in
vain. My <i>Mother</i> was shedding silent
Tears.</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me," said she, "if I
spoke too warmly, or crossly. After his
Kiss, and all! it seemed so ungracious to
take it amiss. But I know too well, he
only used our Wedding-day as a Blind,
and if he gets into these old Ways again,
he will not merely end his own Days in
Jail, but send you there too. So that
protest I must, if I hadn't another Breath
to draw!"</p>

<p>About Noon, Mr. <i>James</i>, one of Lady
<i>Betty's</i> laced Footmen, came to inquire
after a Diamond Ring her Ladyship said
<i>Gatty</i> must have dropped on the Grass.
We looked for it carefully, but could not
find it.</p>

<p>"I dare say we shall find that my <i>Lady</i>
has it at Home all the While," says Mr.
<i>James</i> (which, indeed, proved afterwards
to be the Case). "However, if it
should not turn up, Woe to poor Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<i>Gatty</i>! She will lie under awful Blame
for Heedlessness, if not be counted a
Thief. And pray how is Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> this
Morning? we Servants are all concerned
for her, she is so gentle and pretty-behaved,
though she does keep us at a
Distance! I wish to know on my own
Account, I assure you, as well as to take
back the News to my Lady, though she
does not care much about her, except as
far as her own Convenience goes."</p>

<p>"Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> continues very ill," said
I, "and has twice been seen by a Physician,
who thinks she will take some
Time to recover. You may as well
report this to Lady <i>Betty</i>, for the Doctor
had not paid his second Visit when Mr.
<i>Arbuthnot</i> called."</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>! Why should he
call?" says Mr. <i>James</i>. "Lady <i>Betty</i>
would be mad enough to think he took
the Trouble of knowing whether Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i> were alive or dead."</p>

<p>"He called in order to report her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Condition to Lady <i>Betty</i>" said I. "Rely
on it," said Mr. <i>James</i>, "he called on
his own Account, for Humanity sake, if
nothing more. He hasn't been near my
<i>Lady</i> to-day, and I had it from his Man
that he has gone down to dine in the
Country with the old <i>Earl</i>; that's Lady
<i>Grace's Father</i>. Sure, he must have
named Lady <i>Grace</i>, not Lady <i>Betty</i>."</p>

<p>There was no more to be said, and I
never encourage mere Tattle; but I
thought that good and pretty as <i>Gertrude</i>
was, it could be no Advantage to have a
Gentleman like Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i> concerning
himself about her.</p>

<p>We are all mighty fond of high Matches;
not considering that what is a high Match
on one Side must be a low one on the
other; and that there is little real Happiness
to be looked for where Estates are
widely unequal.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. <i>James</i> whether my <i>Lady</i>
were not much put out by the Loss of her
Woman's Services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>He replied, "Oh no, she keeps one for
Shew and one for Use. Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>,
for as hard a Life as she leads, does
Nothing in Comparison of Madam <i>Pompon</i>,
who is the real Waiting-Maid of
the two. But my <i>Lady</i> requires a
second, who shall have white Hands,
and do Quantities of fine Work, and be
at her Beck and bear with her Humours.
Why should she not require two Women
to sew in her Ante-Chamber, as well as
two Men to hang behind her Chariot?"</p>

<p>Two Women and two Men to wait
upon one! Well! there must needs be
different Levels; and maybe the Time will
come when Habits of Living shall be
simpler. I have read, in one of Mr. <i>Fenwick's</i>
Books, of an <i>English</i> King in old
Times, that had his Barge rowed by eight
other Kings. And of another, that had a
Menial whose sole Office was to lie under
the Table, and chafe and cherish his Majesty's
Feet in cold Weather. <i>King Adoni-bezek</i>
had threescore and ten Kings, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
their Thumbs and great Toes cut off, that
gathered their Meat under his Table.
The making one's own Glory lie in the
abject or lowly State to which we reduce
others, always seems to me to relish of Barbarism,
however high Degree may carry
it off.</p>

<h3><i>The Household of a Virtuoso.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ah!</span> how sorry a Thing is it, when a
Man's Absence from his own Home is felt
by all the Household to be a Relief! My
poor <i>Father</i> kept his Word, of not coming
nigh us, for a good While; and, could we
have been assured of his being well, and
doing well, there would have been no
Alloy to our Comfort under the Deprivation,
however we might feel ashamed to
acknowledge it.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Habit of buying Things
he did not want, had become a Kind of
Disease, that I verily think he could no
longer controul; but it might have been
checked in its first Beginnings in early Life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
for it could not have been born with him.
How careful should People be to shun the
first Temptations to needless and lawless
Expenditure! instead of putting themselves
in the Way of it, as I am free to say
many do, out of mere Wantonness. 'Tis
they that keep up our Lace-Shops and
Auctions, on whose Spoils unprincipled
Dealers grow rich, while honester People
cannot get their Bills paid by them, and so
are ruined. Lady <i>Betty's</i> Man had scarce
left us, when I went to my <i>Father's</i> Wardrobe,
to put away some Linen I had been
repairing; when, in one of the Drawers,
I came upon five Pairs of red Silk Stockings,
worth eight or ten Shillings the Pair,
that had never been so much as put on!
He had bought them, years ago, to wear
with his Sad-coloured Coat and Scarlet
Waistcoat; but the Fashion for them had
already gone by, and one Pair would have
sufficed a Man that needed 'em so seldom;
whereas, I warrant, he took an Half-Dozen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the Matter in Hand. When
I carried Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> his Chocolate
and Rusks, I found him with Writing
Implements and Papers all about, hurriedly
affixing his fine Carnelion Seal to a somewhat
bulky Packet. I said, "Dear Heart,
Sir, are you prudent, do you think, in
writing so much?"</p>

<p>"If you cut me off from writing, Mrs.
<i>Patty</i>," says he, with his pleasant Smile,
"pray what do you leave me? I am
already forbidden to talk, I am unable
to walk, and I cannot always be reading.
Oblige me by porting this Packet by a
safe Hand; or stay, here is a Shilling for
a special Messenger, if you will find
one."</p>

<p>I said, "I will, Sir," and happening to
cast my Eye absently on the Superscription
of the Packet as I withdrew, I saw that it
was addressed to Mr. <i>Paul Caryl</i>, <i>Will's</i>
Coffee-House, which struck me, as I knew
not that he was any Acquaintance of Mr.
<i>Fenwick's</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> continued exceeding ill all
that Day, her Tongue forked and crimson-red,
her Eyes wandering, and her Deliration
incessantly finding Vent in an incoherent
Babble, of which few Words could
be made out, so thick and quick was her
Voice. When Dr. <i>Elwes</i> saw her next,
he shook his Head, and laying his Hand
kindly on my Shoulder, "You are in for
it now, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>," says he. "I don't
believe you will take Infection, but it
may be as well to keep yourself to yourself,
and not go below, especially to your
younger Sister. This poor Thing's Fever
will turn in a few Days; and in the
mean Time, you must continue to be
what you have begun, by being a good
<i>Samaritan</i>." I dropped a few Tears to
hear him talk thus, but he bade me by no
Means to give Way to low Spirits, but take
plenty of generous Nourishment; and he
would set them on their Guard below,
without frightening them. He also said
somewhat of an hired Nurse, but I begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
him not to think of it, unless indeed I
should fall sick myself, and then I would
rather have one than endanger <i>Prue</i>.</p>

<p>When he was gone, I kneeled down and
prayed; then rose with much Composure
and sat down to my Work, which was
making a Net to keep the Flies from the
Pastry, occasionally laying it aside to render
the poor Sufferer what Attention she required.</p>

<p>By and by I heard the Tap of my dear
<i>Mother's</i> Walking-Stick, coming up the
Stairs; but I would by no Means let her
in, only spoke to her through the Door,
as cheerfully as I could, and bade her take
Care of dear <i>Prue</i> and her dear Self.</p>

<p>The next few Days and Nights were
very trying. I obtained a nearer Sight of
the dark Valley we must all pass through
soon or late than I had ever done before.
It seemed to throw an entirely different
Hue over the Face of natural and spiritual
Things, and to shew the littleness of many
Things that are commonly considered great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and the greatness of many that are considered
little.</p>

<p>At length the Fever took a Turn, and
poor <i>Gatty</i> opened her Eyes with a Look
that had Sense and Recognition in it. She
said, "Oh me, how weak I am! Are you
still here, dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>? How strange
it seems to me to be lying a-bed without
hearing my <i>Lady</i> pulling her Bell, and
rapping the Floor with her Slipper!"</p>

<p>I bent over her and kissed her wan Lips,
which she requited by a thankful Smile,
and then dozed off into what I was ready
to believe was a restoring Sleep. I was
very desirous not to disturb it, so sat perfectly
still at my Netting, close to the open
Window, through which the warm Summer
Air came refreshingly, without waving
the white Curtains of the Bed. Mr.
<i>Fenwick's</i> Window, which was also open,
was immediately below; and through it I
could hear Voices, and what they were
saying. I should remark that I afterwards
learnt from <i>Prue</i>, that, from the Time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
my confining myself above Stairs, Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i>, upon whom it had been her Portion
to wait, had been uncommon restless
and fidgetty.</p>

<p>He so seldom received a Visitor, that I
was surprised to hear a Man's Voice in his
Chamber. Nor did I at first think I had
ever heard it before.</p>

<p><i>Prue</i> had probably announced the Name
without its reaching me; for the first Exclamation
I heard was from Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>,
who appeared to start from the Window-Seat,
with, "Sir!&mdash;This Condescension confers
both Honour and Pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Don't name it," said the other easily,
"the Pleasure is mine. I came to see the
ingenious Madman to whom I was indebted
for the Letter and the Manuscript."</p>

<p>"Madman?" repeated Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>,
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madman," reiterated the other,
"for who, in his Senses, would address a
Poem to a Patron almost as penniless as
himself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, there are other Claims to Reverence,"
replied Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, "besides
those of Wealth."</p>

<p>"Truly I hope so," replied his Visitor,
"but I don't know that they are germane
to the present Question. You write a
Poem; you want a <i>Mecnas</i>; and instead
of addressing a laudatory Dedication to
some Peer of Mark and Magnitude, you
light upon a poor Brother Witling and
Authorling like myself."</p>

<p>"Your Courtesy lessens not the Distance
between us," said Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; "you
are a recognised Wit and successful Man
of Letters; I only a poor Aspirant."</p>

<p>"Aye, Man, but Wits don't make one
another's Fortunes. <i>Shakspeare</i>, <i>Spenser</i>,
and <i>Jonson</i>, did not dedicate to one
another. <i>Shakspeare</i> had his <i>Southampton</i>;
<i>Spenser</i> his <i>Raleigh</i>, <i>Sidney</i>, <i>Hatton</i>,
<i>Burleigh</i>, a whole Cloud or Galaxy of
Sponsors."</p>

<p>"There's something wrong and humiliating
in the System," said Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something rotten in the State of
<i>Denmark</i>?" said the other. "Truly
there is! <i>Shakspeare</i> may have unfeignedly
admired <i>Southampton</i> and
<i>Spenser Sidney</i>; but the relation between
Patron and Client has degenerated into
Something unworthy of free, upright
Minds. Does my Thought jump with
yours?"</p>

<p>"It does, I confess to you. I am poor;
most of our Fraternity are. I am cut
off from my professional Duties, and
have employed a Season of Leisure, and
cheated some Hours of Languor, by
what, it must be owned, I composed for
downright Pleasure rather than for Gain.
Yet a Man does not willingly let his
cherished Thoughts die."</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Therefore I aspired to see mine in
Print; inscribed not to some bloated
Peer, more competent to decide on the
Merits of a Pipe of <i>Bordeaux</i> than of
an Ode by <i>Horace</i>, but to some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
whose Genius and turn of Thought I
sincerely admired."</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, have you a private Fortune?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Sir ... only a poor Curacy
of fifty Pounds a Year."</p>

<p>"Your Tastes are expensive, let me
tell you, for a poor Man. Had you
writ your Dedication to my Lord <i>Earlstoke</i>
instead of to me, he might have
given you twenty Pounds!"</p>

<p>"I would rather have burned my
Poem."</p>

<p>"Sir <i>Charles Sefton</i> might have given
you thirty."</p>

<p>"But had I said to him what I have said
to you, it would have been a Lie."</p>

<p>"Pooh! you are too nice. Why, Man,
I have writ Dedications myself. I know
the Market-Value of these Things.
Moreover, the Booksellers will laugh at
you, and probably will refuse to print."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, no great Harm done; I
shall be disappointed, but not heartbroken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Happy for me, I am not writing
for Bread."</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>And I could not catch the Sense nor
Connexion of what followed. Mr. <i>Caryl</i>
seemed to lead away quite from the Subject
in Hand to College Matters, and asking
Mr. <i>Fenwick's</i> Opinion about this and
t'other Poet; for such I took 'em to be,
because they got upon such Names as
<i>Lucretius</i> and <i>Catullus</i>, and others ending
in <i>us</i>, the which I had seen tagged to the
Mottoes of the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>. And
they seemed to talk over their Merits, and
declare their own Opinions of them,
which did not agree, because I heard Mr.
<i>Caryl</i> laugh at Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> for battling so
stoutly with his <i>Patron</i>. Then they got
on to <i>Greek</i> Play-Writers, I think, and
seemed more of a Mind, and to warm
mightily and spout favourite Passages, each
inciting and kindling the other, so that
'twas quite pleasant to hear 'em, even without
understanding a Word of what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
were saying; and I was glad Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
had Company so much to his Mind, that
would make the Morning fly away so fast;
and only hoped he might not over-exert
himself, and suffer for it afterwards. Then
I fell to thinking that if such were his
Tastes and Capacities, what a wide, wide
Barrier there must be between his cultivated
Mind and our uncultivated Minds,
and how trite and poor must seem to him
the very best Remarks that we could offer!
And while I was pursuing this Thought,
and forgetting to hearken to their Discourse,
I was recalled to it all at once by
hearing Mr. <i>Caryl</i> say,</p>

<p>"This won't do; I must be off. Good
Day, Sir!"</p>

<p>And, in shaking Hands with Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>,
I suppose he endeavoured to leave a
Purse in his Hand; for I heard Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
quite energetically say:</p>

<p>"Oh no! No indeed! I cannot think
of it for a Moment! It must not be
so!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And the other; "Nay, but it <i>must</i> be so!
For once, you must flatter my Vanity by
letting me fancy myself a Lord <i>Earlstoke</i>."</p>

<p>"That would, on the contrary, be to
<i>humble</i> your Vanity. In a Word, Sir, I
cannot! you must grant me my Pride,
instead of pretending to gratify your
Vanity; and my Pride is to be a free
Man, and speak the Truth unpaid."</p>

<p>"Well, you are an Eccentricity. I'm
afraid you won't find it answer in the
long Run. I'll tell you what I'll do;
for I <i>must</i> do Something. <i>Cave</i> will
flout at the very idea of publishing
Poems with such a Dedication as yours;
permit me the Use of your Manuscript
for a Day or two. I'll read a Passage
of it here and there at my Coffee-House,
and ditto at <i>Dodsley's</i>, sing its Praises,
and make a Mystery of its Author;
instead of offering it him for Publication,
I'll wait till he makes Advances to me.
See if that won't do!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, you are making me your
Slave&mdash;I mean, your Debtor, for Life!"</p>

<p>"Why, a Debtor <i>is</i> a sort of Slave to
his Creditor, you <i>free Man</i>! See how
soon you are chained! However, don't
let us reckon our Chickens before they
are hatched. The Plan may take, or
may fail. Farewell."</p>

<p>And I heard him lightly run down
Stairs; and looking softly out of my
Window, I could see Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> leaning
on his Window-Sill, his Cheek resting on
his Hand, in profound and, I doubt not,
blissful Reverie. Perhaps a Man more
peacefully happy than he was at that
Moment did not exist.</p>

<h3><i>The Chinese Parlour.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> <i>Gatty's</i> Fever having now turned,
'tis incredible the Gratitude she expressed
to me for all my Care of her during the
course of it. I may say that during the
whole Term, the only Concern Lady
<i>Betty</i> shewed whether she were likely to
sink or swim, was conveyed in a single
Message, and that of the briefest; to
know, was she about yet? a likely Thing,
when the Girl was at that Moment in a
Fever-Lethargy! <i>Gatty</i> took it mighty
little to Heart, I must say for her, when
she learned how little Recollection of her
had been intimated; and she said, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Smile, she was ready to wish they should
forget her altogether, so content was she to
remain, and so loth to go back.</p>

<p>And now her Appetite mended apace,
and she began to regain Colour and Flesh,
and the Chamber was fumigated, and she
had a warm Bath, and Dr. <i>Elwes</i> pronounced
that she might go below with
Safety to herself and others. We resolved
to make a little Festival of it, and asked
him to sup with us, which he cheerfully
consented to; and I had Pleasure in combing
out <i>Gatty's</i> long fine Hair, which she
was yet unequal to doing herself, and arranging
her Dress with some Air of Smartness.</p>

<p>After this, she reclined in the Arm-Chair
by the Window, to repose herself a little
before she went down Stairs. Meanwhile,
I tended a Rose that grew in a Pot that
stood in the Window-Sill, and had just
finished watering it, when, as Ill-Luck would
have it, the Water, filtering too quickly
through the Pot, descended copiously on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
some one who had got his Head out of
the Window beneath.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Who's that, giving me a
Shower-Bath?" cries Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; at
the first Sound of whose Voice I drew
my Head in quickly, and we both fell a
laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't let us answer," says <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p>"Let us both put our Heads out at
the same Moment," said I, "and then
he won't know which it was."</p>

<p>It was a pert Thing to do, but we were
just then in cheerful Spirits; so we looked
out, without looking down, quite unconcernedly.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so much better,
Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>," said Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; "poor
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, though, looks all the worse
for her shutting up. You remind me
of the two Damsels in <i>Don Quixote</i>,
looking through the Inn-Casement, and
plotting Mischief."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Sir," says <i>Gatty</i>, so softly
that I only heard her, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
withdrawing and sitting down. I did the
same, actuated by that nameless Feeling
which often tells Women what is seemly
and becoming for them to do, without
enabling them to say why.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> shyly begged me to go down
first, because she said my <i>Mother</i> and <i>Sister</i>
would be glad to see me; which indeed
they were. <i>Prue</i> had set out our little
Parlour in the prettiest Way imaginable.&mdash;My
<i>Father's</i> Arm-Chair was placed for
<i>Gatty</i> at the little <i>Gothic</i> Window wreathed
with Jessamine; my <i>Mother's</i> Chair was
in its accustomed Place. This Room was
hung with a very expensive <i>Chinese</i> Paper,
that had cost my <i>Father</i> I am afraid to say
how much per Yard, and which was
covered with Groups of <i>Chinese</i> Figures
illustrating the Manners and Customs of
that Empire, depicted with extraordinary
Liveliness and Verisimilitude; no two
Groups alike. This Paper-hanging had
been <i>Prue's</i> and my Picture-Gallery for
many a Year; and when we were Children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and my <i>Father</i> had it by him in
Pieces, we had needed no other Entertainment
on rainy Days; preventing the
long Rolls from curling up by setting a
Caddy on one End, and a Work-Box on
the other. Corresponding with this Paper
were sundry Josses and Jars, much fitter
for Lady <i>Betty</i> than for us; and the
Mantel-Shelf was decorated with Nosegays
of fresh Flowers; my <i>Mother</i> having put
the Five Senses carefully away, for Fear
they should share the Fate of the Shepherdesses.
As for the Tea-Table, never was
such a Spread! Fancy-Bread, Buns, and
Cakes of all Descriptions, cold Fowl,
marbled Veal, delicate Slices of pink Ham,
and a superb Dish of ripe Grapes. Dear
<i>Prue</i>, whom I had not seen for some
Days, was blooming with Health and
Sprightliness. She had put on a pretty
chintz Muslin over her Pea-green silk
Petticoat, with a Knot or two of pale
pink Ribbon to her Stomacher, and her
best Muslin Apron worked with Pansies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Sweet-Peas. A Sweet-Pea she was
herself! so brightly, delicately tinted with
Colour! so pliant, slim, and debonnaire!
When we were little Girls, kind Dr.
<i>Elwes</i> had been wont to say we were as
like as two Peas,&mdash;two Sweet-Peas; but
somehow, I fell off afterwards, lost my
Bloom and Freshness, grew lanky and
angular, while <i>Prue's</i> scarlet Lips and
carmine Cheeks, and violet-blue Eyes,
grew brighter and deeper every Day; only
she stopped growing too soon, and, but
for her neat Make, would have been too
round.</p>

<p>Well, I went up for Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>, and
entering somewhat too softly, surprised her
on her Knees. She slightly coloured as
she rose, but said Nothing, and putting
her Arm within mine, went down Stairs;
having doubtlessly vented her Gratitude
for late Mercies received, in pious Ejaculation,
which made me love her all the
better. My <i>Mother's</i> and <i>Sister's</i> Reception
of her was most cordial, to which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
responded with the utmost Cheerfulness;
and we vied with one another in Alacrity
in conducting her to her Seat, and bolstering
her up in it. "Of course, you know,"
said I to <i>Prudence</i>, "that Dr. <i>Elwes</i> is
going to join us by and by."&mdash;"Oh, yes,"
says she, "and Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> too;" which
startled me a little, and made me cast a
furtive Glance at myself in a little oval
Mirrour in a Shell-work Frame that hung
by the Window. The View was not
satisfactory; in dressing <i>Gertrude</i>, I had
neglected bestowing Pains on myself:
besides, my wan Look and heavy Eyes
were what no Pains could remedy. I
suppressed a little Sigh, and looked at
<i>Gatty</i>. Pale as she yet was, even <i>Prue's</i>
Beauty faded before hers, into the buxom
Bloom of a Milkmaid. <i>Gertrude's</i> Loveliness
was independent of red and white,
though the delicate Muslin Kerchief over
her Neck was not purer than the lily
Throat it enclosed. For Convenience sake,
I had tied her abundant Hair in a Club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
behind, low down on the Poll, with a
broad black Ribband; her Gown was of
the plainest mourning Stuff; yet there she
sate, an enthroned Queen for Beauty in its
Glory, without being in the least conscious
of it. Of course, Angels are beautiful without
being vain; I think <i>Gatty</i> was as removed
from Vanity as an Angel, and almost as
beautiful. There was a Dignity, Repose,
and Thought about her, that made you
conclude her Mind to be set upon Something
high, even without her speaking a
Word. As all this struck me, I felt inclined
to slip away and smarten myself;
but then thought, why should I? I'm
trim and neat, though neither pretty nor
gay; to aim at matching <i>Gatty</i> would be
futile; and as for looking wan, why, <i>she's</i>
my Reward; for, in nursing her into Health,
I have neglected my own.</p>

<p>So I remained as I was; and presently
came down Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, who, <i>Prudence</i>
told me, had been quite another Man since
Mr. <i>Caryl's</i> Visit. Close on his Heels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
followed Dr. <i>Elwes</i>, in his best Wig and
Ruffles, with a Flower in his Button-Hole;
so our gala Preparations were by no Means
in vain. Then our little Feast began:
with two such Men at Table, 'twould
have been surprising if good Conversation
had been wanting, and every one seemed
in happy Tune. As for the Doctor, he
was quite on the merry Pin, praised the
Cream, Butter, and Cakes, partook of
Everything, and complimented us handsomely
all round. I believe my dear <i>Mother</i>
had not had such a tranquilly pleasant
Evening for many a Day. I presided at
the Tea-Board, which was supplied with
fairy-like Cups without Handles, of real
China, and the Tea-Caddy was real Chinese
too, one of my poor <i>Father's</i> Purchases.
<i>Prue</i> tripped off now and then into the
Shop; but our Man <i>Peter</i> was on Duty
there, as well as <i>Saunders's</i> Daughter, so
that we could leave the Business pretty
safely in their Charge.</p>

<p>All at once enters <i>Nanny Saunders</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the Shop, with a Face as red as Currant-Jelly;
and, "Sir,&mdash;Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>!" says
she, "here's a Gentleman of Quality
inquiring for you!" and without more
ado, ushers Mr. <i>Paul Caryl</i> in upon us.</p>

<p>For my Part, I felt greatly confused;
the rest expressed by their Looks simple
Surprise, all except Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, who, upsetting
his Cup (which luckily was empty)
in his Hurry to rise, and colouring very
red, hastened to meet his Guest.</p>

<p>"Faith, I find you pleasantly engaged,
Sir!" were the easy, lively Words first
spoken by our Man of Fashion. "Don't
let me disturb any one, pray.&mdash;May I
request to be presented to the Ladies?"
And he bowed upon my <i>Mother's</i> Hand as
if she had been a Duchess, saluted <i>Prue</i>
and me more distantly, and stood at pause
for a Moment when he came to <i>Gatty</i>,
then bowed low, noticed the Doctor, and
then turned to Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>.</p>

<p>"I've good News for you," said he
gaily, "so thought I would bring it myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
I know how I should have liked
it, had I been in your Place. But suppose
we postpone it a little, and enjoy
the Goods the Gods provide us. Why
should we forget the universal Doom of
Man&mdash;'<i>Fruges consumere nati</i>'? Ha,
Sir?"</p>

<p>I mutely offered him a Dish of Tea,
which he immediately accepted; and, as
he sipped it, he addressed some trifling
Remark to my <i>Mother</i>, who cheerfully
replied. Many Persons would have been
completely fluttered by the Entry of an
unexpected Guest, of a Grade so removed
from their own; but my <i>Mother</i> never
lost her Self-Possession or Self-Respect;
which on this Occasion was so influential
on all around her, that we almost immediately
regained our Ease, and became as
cheerful and chatty as we had been before.</p>

<p>"Upon my Life, this is a very pleasant
little Interlude!" cried Mr. <i>Caryl</i>.
"What a lucky Fellow I am! Always
falling on my Legs! Here, now, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I dropped into the midst of a most
agreeable little Tea-Party, and am made
welcome to all these good Things as if
my Presence were no Intrusion!"</p>

<p>"Don't name Intrusion, Sir," says my
<i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"But I <i>must</i> name it, Madam! Most
abominable Intrusion! Hum,&mdash;hum,&mdash;I
can't help thinking I have seen that
Lady's Face before"&mdash;with his Eyes
full upon <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p>"The Day Lady <i>Betty</i> was here, Sir."</p>

<p>"Bless my Soul, yes! I remember all
about it now. Most unlucky occurrence!
You're quite recovered, Ma'am,
I hope?"</p>

<p>And he seemed all at once to reflect,
that, whereas he had been here on a previous
Occasion with my <i>Lady</i>, he was now
taking Tea with the Lady's Maid. Too
well-bred to behave superciliously, he
nevertheless said not another Syllable to
<i>Gatty</i>, but kept eyeing her continually
like a fine Picture. For her Part, <i>Gatty</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
looked so little towards him, that I believe
she was quite unconscious of the Attention.
A Physician is fit Company for Anybody;
and Dr. <i>Elwes</i> put some Question about
the News of the Day, which soon led to
general and fluent Conversation. Mr.
<i>Caryl</i> was evidently not aiming to shine,
as when at Lady <i>Betty's</i> Table. I cannot
recall one witty Thing that he said; but,
on the other Hand, there was a racy,
genial flow of small Talk, in which all
could take their Share, and no one felt
distanced or outshone, that was even better
than <i>Bon-mot</i> or Repartee. Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
was, I believe, on the Tenter-Hooks, at
first, for Mr. <i>Caryl's</i> good News; but soon
making out that it was not immediately
forthcoming, he gave himself up to the Enjoyment
of the passing Moment. Ere Tea
was well over, they fell to some amusing
Play upon Words, that must be shown upon
Paper. Writing Implements were immediately
found Room for; and from one
ingenious Puzzle to another they went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
now giving us Anagrams to make out,
now sending round Quips and Queries that
each was to answer in their own Fashion,
till Doctor <i>Elwes</i> exclaimed, "Oh, Brag
and Loo! how well we can do without
you!"</p>

<p>I whispered to him softly, "Shall I fill
your Pipe, Sir?"</p>

<p>"No!" returns he, with equal Quietness,
"I meant to have had one, but
these young Sparks keep me awake
without it. They're monstrous good
Company, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>And so we went on as merry as Crickets,
till I began to think of two Things at
once; that is to say, of two Dozen&mdash;the
Anagram before me&mdash;and Sausage Rolls,
Oyster Patties, stewed Sweetbreads, and
so forth for Supper; and to be sensible
that I must go and look after them. Just
then, I noticed a distressed look cross <i>Prue's</i>
Face at some little Attention Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
paid Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>. "Dear me, how foolish
of you, <i>Prue</i>," thought I, "to be vexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by Anything like that! Why, he cares
very little about <i>you</i>, and Nothing at all
for <i>her</i>!" And, stealing from my Seat,
I was about to withdraw quietly to the
Kitchen, when suddenly the Parlour-Door
flies wide open, and on the Threshold stands
my poor <i>Father</i>, with a Face as red as
his Waistcoat, who after giving an amazed
Glance round about him, exclaims:</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! Who are all these young
Fellows, amusing themselves in my <i>Chinese</i>
Parlour?"</p>

<p>I thought Mr. <i>Caryl</i> would have gone
into Fits with suppressed Laughter. "Sir,"
said he, advancing and bowing, "I as the
chief Intruder, beg to introduce myself
by the Name of Mr. <i>Paul Caryl</i>, of the
<i>Inner Temple</i>, at your Service; and this
is my Friend and your Lodger, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>,
whom I have made a Call upon.
The other Gentleman, you will perceive,
is your Family Physician."</p>

<p>"You seem all monstrous merry and
mightily at Home with one another,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
says my <i>Father</i>, who evidently had, as was
but too common, taken a little too much;
"I almost seem like an Interloper in my
own House; however, I don't care if I
have a cheerful Glass with you to improve
our Acquaintance. Hallo! where's
my Chair gone? I had like to have sat
down upon the Floor."</p>

<p>"Here, Sir," said <i>Gatty</i>, hastily rising.</p>

<p>"Here, Sir? and who are <i>you</i>, Madam?
I don't remember ever to have seen your
Face before; not an ugly one, neither!
Pray, are you Mrs. <i>Paul Caryl</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Who then? Mrs. ... Mrs. ... I
shall forget my own Name next; hum!
Hallo! Why, where are my Senses?"</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Caryl</i> and Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> looked at
him in Amazement; while <i>we</i> knew what
he missed, well enough.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" reiterated he, raising
his Voice very loud, and stamping the
Floor. "Woman!" addressing my <i>Mother</i>,
"where, I say, are my Five Senses?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>, they're safe in
the China Cupboard," began my <i>Mother</i>,
which set Mr. <i>Caryl</i> off in an inextinguishable
Fit of Laughter.</p>

<p>"Are these your Manners, Sir?" cries
my <i>Father</i>, fiercely turning upon him.</p>

<p>"'Pon my Honour, I'm ashamed of
them," says Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, covering his Face
in his Cambric Handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Where are my Senses, I say?" recommences
my <i>Father</i>; on which Mr.
<i>Caryl</i>, unable to stand it any longer, rushes
into the Shop, and Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> after him.
There we hear them, while my poor <i>Father</i>
still continues raging, giving way to
fresh Peals of Laughter, which they vainly
attempt to smother; and at length Mr.
<i>Caryl</i> departs, without returning to wish
us good bye; and Dr. <i>Elwes</i> shortly goes
also, giving us knowing Looks, and advising
<i>Gatty</i> and me to go immediately to
Bed. And so ended the Evening.</p>

<h3><i>Two Poets under a Dairy-Window.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> Morning, my <i>Father</i> at his Breakfast
questioned us straitly as to what had
been going on during his Absence, and
seemed scarcely to know whether to take
Offence at it or not. The receiving and
nursing a Stranger under Mrs. <i>Gatty's</i> Circumstances
would have been Something
to cavil at; but then she was own Woman
to Lady <i>Betty</i>, for whom, though he only
knew her in Public, he entertained great
Respect; and besides, Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> was a
fine Woman, which of itself was a Letter
of Recommendation to him. Moreover,
she sat by all the While, knitting a White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Silk Mitten; so that he could not, for
Manners, speak against her in her Hearing;
and my <i>Father</i>, when himself, was a well-mannered
Man. So he hemmed once or
twice, and swallowed any Objections he
might have made, had we been by ourselves;
and then, to turn the Subject, "Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i>," says he, "that Mitten will become
your Hand well; but most other
Women's Fingers, coming out of it,
would look like Radishes. And now,
let us clear Decks, and make way for
the Carpenters."</p>

<p>"The Carpenters, <i>Father</i>?" repeated
<i>Prue</i> and I in a breath.</p>

<p>"Aye, there are a couple of Fellows
coming down to put up two little Shelves
and Brackets, for some little Matters that
the Mantel-Piece is too shallow for. I
bespoke the Men overnight, and brought
the Toys in with me. Here, <i>Peter</i>, you
Knave, bring them in."</p>

<p>Where was the Use of saying Anything?</p>

<p>"Now," says he, laughing as he unpacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
them, "here are the comicallest
Things you ever saw in your life; and so
<i>you'll</i> say, Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>. Look here&mdash;a
rural Piece in Cherry-Wood Carving,
Farm-Yard and Farm-House; a Beggar
approaching the Door. I wind it up behind,
like a Time-Piece. Now, mark
you, the Fun of the Thing! The Beggar
advances&mdash;out flies a Mastiff from
the House, and furiously attacks him! ha,
ha, ha!</p>

<p>"Now, look at this other, its Companion;
a lone House in the Country;
Time, Peep of Day.... A Thief getting
in at a First-Floor Window, by Means
of a Ladder ... <i>Hodge</i>, coming out of
the Barn, with a Pitchfork, assails him
from behind,&mdash;you shall see how, as soon
as I have wound it up. Now then! ho!
ho! ho! see how he digs into him."</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> burst into such an irrepressible
Fit of pretty Laughter, that my <i>Father</i>
was her sworn Friend from that Moment;
while <i>Prue</i> and I, influenced by mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Feelings of Vexation and Amusement,
laughed with more Constraint.</p>

<p>While my <i>Father</i> was making <i>Hodge</i>
assail the Marauder again and again, and
each Time bursting into fresh Peals of
Merriment, enters to him <i>Peter</i>, with a
Paper in his Hand, a Glance at which
changed my <i>Father's</i> Note in an Instant.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, <i>Peter</i>!" says he; "why,
your Face is a Yard long! What's your
Name, Man? your Sirname, I mean."</p>

<p>"<i>Greaves</i> is my Sirname, Sir&mdash;<i>Peter
Greaves</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Peter Grievous</i>, it should ha' been!
<i>Peter Grievous-had-a-Cat!</i> And your
Crest, a Cat proper, with the Motto,
'When I'm pleased, I purr!' But this
is no purring Matter, <i>Peter</i>; tell the
Fellow who brought this Paper, that
I'm not at Home&mdash;I sha'n't be, by the
Time you get to him."</p>

<p>And, snatching up his Hat, he hastily
made off through the Glass-Door into the
Garden; and thence, no Doubt, to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Crony, <i>Don Saltero</i>, for whom, indeed, he
had such a profound Admiration, that I
believe no Title of Honour could have
been conferred on himself that he would
have liked half as well as that of <i>Don
Honeywood-o</i>. When he was gone, <i>Prue</i>
and I locked up the new Purchases, and
sent away the Carpenters, telling them to
await future Orders; and <i>Gatty</i> wrote a
Billet to Lady <i>Betty</i>, to acquaint her with
her Amendment, and request Directions
concerning her Return. Meanwhile, I
was carrying up Mr. <i>Fenwick's</i> Chocolate,
when <i>Prue</i>, meeting me on the Stairs, said,
"Oh, I meant to have saved you that
Trouble, dear <i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied, "I am able to return
to all my little Duties now; you have
too long worked for both."</p>

<p>"I don't think of that," replied she,
with a little Disappointment in her Air;
"Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> has got used to me now,
and I thought you would be better for
a little Rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, <i>Prudence, Prudence</i>!" thought I,
as I pursued my Way, "this reminds
me of the passing Shade on your Brow
Yesterday Evening, when he was attending
to Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>. Beware of playing,
like a Moth, round a Candle, my dear
little Sister, for it will lead to no good."</p>

<p>When I went in, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> looked
round briskly from his Writing-Table,
with a Smile, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Why, I have been expecting&mdash;oh! is
it you, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>? (with a scarcely
perceptible Change in his Voice); I have
been expecting my Chocolate, I was going
to say, this Half-Hour or more; but pray
don't think me impatient&mdash;I'm sure I
ought not to be so hungry, considering
how you feasted me last Night. 'Tis a
Sign of returning Health, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I fervently hope it may be, Sir," said
I. "Most likely it is. I am sure every
Thing in the Way of Nourishment this
House contains is at your Service."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"Yes, I really believe I am getting well&mdash;have
turned the Corner, in Fact; and
when I have taken this nice Chocolate,
I think I shall go and bask in the Sun
under those Elm-Trees yonder."</p>

<p>"Then I will put a Cushion for you,
Sir, on the Garden-Seat, and a Foot-stool
on the Grass before it; for indeed you
must not get chilled!"</p>

<p>"Nay, you will coddle me too much&mdash;you
have made me too luxurious a Fellow
already. You don't suppose I had
all these Vagaries in <i>Shoreditch</i>, do you?
I want to be there again, though!&mdash;I
long to return to my poor People; only,
I don't know that my Voice is yet strong
enough, either for Preaching or Reading.
I must make Trial of it, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>;
I must begin by small Degrees. I was
thinking, that if you happened to be by
yourselves this Evening, it might not be
unagreeable to you for me to come down
and read to you all for a little While&mdash;just
for Practice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"By ourselves, Sir?&mdash;My <i>Father</i> may
or may not be at Home; we are unlikely
to have any one else; and I am sure your
Plan will be a very delightful one to
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Very well; we will wait till the Time
comes, then, to see if it be convenient.
You are all well this Morning, I hope?
Your <i>Mother</i>, and <i>Sister</i>, and Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i>?"</p>

<p>"All well, I kindly thank you, Sir.&mdash;I
hear myself called ... I believe I am
wanted in the Shop."</p>

<p>I made use of the first spare Moment,
to run and place the Foot-stool and Cushion
under the Elms, and then returned to my
Post behind the Counter. In the course
of the Afternoon, enters Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, who
salutes me with easy Urbanity.</p>

<p>"Good Morning, Ma'am," says he;
"pray, is Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> within?"</p>

<p>"I believe, Sir, he is sitting under the
Elms in our little Pleasure-Ground,"
said I; "I will show you the Way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's no Need; I know it already,"
says he. "Pray, don't trouble yourself."</p>

<p>However, I knew what were Manners.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he, as we passed through
the Parlour, which happened to be vacant,
"what a pleasant Evening we had in this
Room last Night, and how funnily it
ended!&mdash;Pray, Ma'am, has the Gentleman
yet found his five Senses?"</p>

<p>And I saw he was brimful of Mirth,
that was ready to explode at the merest
Word.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "allow me to say that
you did not know where the Gift of that
Speech lay last Night. My <i>Father</i> had
presented my <i>Mother</i> with a Group of
Porcelain Figures, representing the Five
Senses, which she, in her Care for them,
had put away."</p>

<p>"Was that all?" cried he, his Countenance
immediately changing. "Oh, I
see!&mdash;aye, aye&mdash;How absurd my Blunder
was! Upon my Word, Ma'am, I beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
your Pardon for having been so unmannerly.
Shocking! shameful!"</p>

<p>Here we came upon Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, who
finding himself exposed to a chill Current
of Air under the Elms, had got under the
Shelter of the House, where my <i>Father</i>
had set up a pretty enough rustical Seat,
just outside of our Dairy Wire-Lattice.
Hence it came to pass that I, being presently
engaged in seeing the Afternoon
Milk brought in, heard a good deal of
what passed between the two Gentlemen,
whether I would or no.</p>

<p>"I've secured <i>Dodsley's</i> Ear," says Mr.
<i>Caryl</i>, cheerfully, "so that I fancy I have
but to speak a Word to secure your
Piece a Place in his <i>Collection</i>. Nothing
remains to be done but for you to attend
to a little Revision in the first Place,
before you submit it to his critical Eye.
What say you?"</p>

<p>"Say? That I am infinitely obliged."</p>

<p>"'Let my future Life,' &amp;c.&mdash;hey?
We'll suppose that all spoken. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
here is your Manuscript; I've just scored
through what I think had better be
altered and left out. You are not
doubtful of my Judgment, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Surely not&mdash;Just allow me to see."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look <i>here</i>,&mdash;and <i>here</i>&mdash;those had
better come out. Here again.... What's
'Ph&oelig;bus' Mane?'"</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;bus' <i>Wain</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. That's your bad writing;
<i>Hand</i>-writing, of course, I mean. Here
again, 'thwarting Thunder.'"</p>

<p>"That's Miltonic."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>And heal the Harms of thwarting Thunder blue.</i>'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Hum! Well then, it strikes me, that
<i>Milton</i> having said so once, you had
better not say it again."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will not."</p>

<p>"Then, this about Truth. It's very
bad&mdash;will never do. I was obliged to
skip it in reading to <i>Dodsley</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Why? Why, because it isn't the Thing!&mdash;won't
go down, Sir! You carry it out
too far, farther than Anybody goes; it's so
much Clap-Trap, and spoils what's real."</p>

<p>"But it is not Clap-Trap. It says no
more than I mean and feel! No, no;
I'll give up verbal Points to your better
Taste, but in Matters of Principle, I
cannot alter."</p>

<p>"Nay then, the Thing's at an End, for
I honestly tell you I won't concern myself
with it as it stands. You may
surely allow me some <i>little</i> Knowledge
of these Things. However, it's no Use
talking to an infatuated Man&mdash;otherwise,
there is another Passage I was
going to propose to you to withdraw,
which doubtless you will maintain to be
the best in the Manuscript."</p>

<p>"Which is that?"</p>

<p>"This, about the Water-Nymphs."</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I think it pretty, and can't
see what there is to object to in it; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to yield to your better Taste, it shall be
withdrawn, if you like."</p>

<p>"My dear <i>Fenwick</i>! you don't say so?"</p>

<p>"I say so, and mean it too."</p>

<p>"Why, this will be a great Sacrifice of
yours, especially as it is against your own
Judgment,&mdash;of one of the most showy
Passages, though I won't say one of the
best!"</p>

<p>"Never mind! Let it be so."</p>

<p>"Come, this is docile and agreeable of
you. The Men at <i>Will's</i>, in Fact, extolled
this Passage, and pronounced it to
be my own! Taxed me with reading
a Poem I had written, as that of another
Hand!"</p>

<p>"Nay, now the Water-Nymphs begin
to rise in Value in my Eyes."</p>

<p>"In Fact, I <i>had</i> said Something like this,
only not so well, in a former Piece; and
they thought I had now worked it out,
and improved on it. So that you see I
don't exactly want our Things to clash;
nor to get you accused of Plagiary...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, not another Word.&mdash;The
Passage shall be omitted."</p>

<p>"Well, I like this; I like your Feeling.
Thank you, thank you. We need never
allude to it."</p>

<p>"Never again."</p>

<p>"As for 'Truth,' let it stand. You
have yielded a Point to me, I'll yield one
to you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, for I really could
not have withdrawn that Passage."</p>

<p>"And I'll speak to <i>Dodsley</i> to-morrow,
and get you into the <i>Collection</i>; so expect
a Proof-Sheet at no very distant
Date, and then we shall look on you as
one of the Guild."</p>

<p>And shaking Hands with him, Mr. <i>Caryl</i>
departed.</p>

<p>This Conversation afforded me afterwards,
as I sat netting behind the Counter,
Subject for a good deal of Thought. Here
was Jealousy peeping out again; a great
Poet jealous of a small one; for so, without
any competent Knowledge of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
respective Merits, I concluded them to be.
But if (which I was not sure of) Mr. <i>Caryl</i>
were the better Poet, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> was the
better Man. I had seen him absorbed in
the Composition of that Poem Day after
Day; he had given it the nicest Finish in
his Power; there were Thoughts in it
which he cherished as part of himself, and
would not be false to, nor give up, to
please any Patron in the World; but yet a
favourite Passage, the Fancy and Expression
of which he believed to be good, but
which another Man was envious of, he
could obliterate with Magnanimity. That
seemed a great Word for a little Thing;
but was it a little Thing? The Wits at
<i>Will's</i> had applauded it; had given it to
a popular Writer; then the real Writer
deserved to be as popular. He might
have been as popular, had he kept it in;
he might not become popular if it were
taken out. Then again, Expediency. Had
it crossed his Mind that it was expedient
to keep well with Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Expense of a Passage of Poetry? That
did not seem like Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; I did
not believe the Thought had weighed
with him.</p>

<p>Then I proceeded, in my Foolishness
and Self-Ignorance, to ponder how strange
it was that it should be hard to Anybody
of Common-Sense and Good-Feeling, to
hear:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Praise of another with unwounded Ear.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why now," thought I to myself, "<i>I</i>
have never found it a hard Matter to do
so. These many Years I have known
that Everybody considered <i>Prudence</i>
pretty <i>Prue</i>, and me plain <i>Patty</i>, and
yet I have never experienced the slightest
Emotion of Envy or Jealousy on that
Account."</p>

<p>Ah! we little know ourselves. "The
Heart is deceitful above all Things, and
desperately wicked&mdash;who can know it?"
That's the Scriptural Account of the Matter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and however we may gloss it over,
escape from it, or flatly disbelieve in it
altogether, it turns out to be the true one
at last.</p>

<h3><i>Duties of my Lady's Own Woman.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gatty</span> was circumspect not to occupy
my <i>Father's</i> Arm-Chair this Evening,
whether he came to claim it or no.
When the Tea-Things were set, I stept
up to Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> to let him know we
were ready.</p>

<p>"So soon?" said he, looking up from
his Book; "why, do you want me to read
to you before Tea?"</p>

<p>"We hope you will oblige us with your
Company to Tea, Sir," said I.</p>

<p>"Nay then," said he, in high Good-Humour,
"I'll join you directly." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
closing his Book with Alacrity, he followed
me down Stairs.</p>

<p>We had made no Difference, to <i>call</i>
Difference, for him this Evening. He
took us as he found us; and chatted away
on this and that, as much one of ourselves
as if he had not a Word of <i>Latin</i> or <i>Greek</i>
in his Head. Once or twice I tried to
lead to Something I thought he would
have liked better,&mdash;Something on which
he could have harangued while it would
have behoved us to listen; but he darted
away from it directly, and <i>would</i> keep down
to the Level of his Company, without
seeming to mind it.</p>

<p>After Tea, we all took out our Work,
and my <i>Mother</i> began to snip a Fly-catcher.</p>

<p>"Oh, now you expect me to read, I
suppose," said he; but still delayed, to
chat and laugh about this and the other
Trifle with <i>Prudence</i> and <i>Gatty</i>, till at last,
a sudden Pause occurring, he had no Excuse
for idling any longer.</p>

<p>He said he would, with our Leave, read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
us <i>Shenstone's "Schoolmistress</i>." We had
never heard of it, and were quite willing
to hear it on his Recommendation. He
said it was a Burlesque in the <i>Spenserian</i>
Stanza. We knew what a Burlesque was,
but not what was a <i>Spenserian</i> Stanza.
He said, Illustration was the best Explanation,
and began at once. His Voice and
Manner of reading were so musical, that I
liked the Melody; and could follow him
with Ease till he got to "<i>Libs</i>, <i>Notus</i>, and
<i>Auster</i>." I suppose he guessed we might
be at Fault, so checked himself to tell us
they were Names of the Winds. Then he
was about to resume, when <i>Prue</i> interrupted
him with, "Pray, Sir, what is
<i>unkempt</i>?"</p>

<p>"Uncombed, to be sure," put in <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I have been thinking
of it ever so long, and could not make
out what it was."</p>

<p>"If I come to Anything you wish to
know, pray don't scruple to stop me,"
says Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; and went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by, <i>Prue</i> gets treading on
<i>Gatty's</i> Foot at&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>As erst the Bard by Mulla's Silver Stream</i>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and <i>Gatty</i> frowns at her. Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>,
perceiving some By-Play going on, stops
to ask if they have Anything to say.
<i>Prudence</i> hangs her Head over her Work,
colours a little, and says, "No, Sir."</p>

<p>"I believe," says Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, glancing
over the Leaves, "I had better
modernize the old Style a little, that you
may follow it better."</p>

<p>We all thanked him, except <i>Prudence</i>,
who said she liked it best as it was.</p>

<p>"Why? Did she understand it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then why did she like it?"</p>

<p>"Because she did." This Answer made
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> laugh; but I must say I
thought it very stupid. However, he
went on, till within a few Verses of the
End; when my <i>Father</i> walked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, laying down the Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with that Cheerfulness and Self-Possession
which so well became him, took the first
Word, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Evening, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>! Here
am I, you see, reading to your good
Wife and Daughters, and trying to prepare
myself for Duty on a larger Scale."</p>

<p>"Sir, you do us honour," says my <i>Father</i>,
quite civilly; "your Company must be an
Honour to us at any Time, whenever you
please to bestow it on us. Pray go on."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can wait a little While," says
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>. "Pray, is there any News
stirring?"</p>

<p>"There's a Whale in the <i>Thames</i>," says
my Father.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried we all.</p>

<p>"And there's an Eye-lash in my Eye,"
continues he; "pray, Mrs. <i>Honeywood</i>,
come and take it out."</p>

<p>While my <i>Mother</i> was thus engaged,
we chatted among ourselves. "What will
you have, <i>Father</i>?" said I. "Shall I
make you some Tea?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'd rather you put on Supper
half an Hour, and let me have Something
broiled, and some mulled Wine and
Toast."</p>

<p>When I returned from giving Orders,
I found my <i>Father</i> established in his Arm-Chair,
my <i>Mother</i> returned to her Snipping,
<i>Prue</i> and <i>Gatty</i> embroidering different
Corners of the same Apron, and
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> ready to resume his Reading.
The Poem was soon finished, and when
we had talked it over a little, he asked us
what he should read next. I said I
thought he had better not do too much at
first, and Supper would soon be ready.
He said, "Oh, he was just getting into
the Humour of it, and there was Plenty
of Time to read some short Piece before
Supper." So then my <i>Mother</i> said she
thought a Paper of the <i>Tatler</i> would be
just long enough; and mentioned a favourite
Number that she had not read for
a good While&mdash;that charming Piece<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
beginning,&mdash;"There are several Persons
who have many Pleasures and Entertainments
in their Possession which they do
not enjoy;" and proceeding to give such
a touching Picture of domestic Felicity.
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> read it with such Feeling
that we were all delighted with it; and it
seemed to me that even my <i>Father</i>, who
sat quite silent, with his Back to us, was
moved by it, for I noticed his breathing
very hard,&mdash;his only Way of expressing
strong Feeling. "Ah!" thought I to
myself, "if Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> were to read to
us in this nice Way every Evening, and
my <i>Father</i> were to grow fond of it and
of him, and get into the Way of coming
Home early, instead of sipping Spirits
and Water with <i>Don Saltero</i>, how happy
we should be!"</p>

<p>"And now," says my <i>Mother</i>, "there's
a Sequel to that Paper, which I should
very much like to hear, save for the Fear
of tiring Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not at all tired," said he;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pray give it me; for I am already quite
in love with this good Man and his
Wife."</p>

<p>So my <i>Mother</i> looked him out No. 114,
which begins, "I was walking about my
Chamber this Morning in a very gay
Humour, when I saw a Coach stop at
my Door, and a Youth of about fifteen
alight out of it,"&mdash;and goes on to describe
the Death of the Wife and Mother
of the Family. We were presently all in
Tears; <i>Gatty</i> even sobbing; and Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i> seemed irresolute once or twice
whether to proceed or stop. However,
he went on, and when he came to the
Husband fainting, my Attention was
divided between him and my <i>Father</i>,
who at that Crisis gave not a Sigh but
a Snore. He was fast asleep. My <i>Mother</i>,
ashamed of him, gave him a little Nudge,
and said, "My Dear!" on which he turned
on his Side, murmured, "Very like a
Whale!" and was off again as sound
as a Top. None of us could help laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a little, and after this, there were no more
Tears shed. We supped, and separated
for the Night.</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> and I still slept together; and, as
we were undressing, she said, "I fear your
Sister thought me affected to-night
for crying at that Death-Bed Scene;
she gave me such a Look! Indeed I
could not help it; I have witnessed one
so much like it; and my Spirits are yet
tender."</p>

<p>I said, "Pray do not think of it again&mdash;<i>Prudence</i>
has that sharp Look sometimes,
and seems just now under some little
Misapprehension; but in the Main, there
cannot be a better Creature. She has
not seen so much of you as I have, but
yet, I am sure she likes you, and admires
you too."</p>

<p>"Nobody can do that," says <i>Gatty</i>;
"but I don't want to be admired, though
I own it is pleasant to me to be liked,
and not to be misapprehended."</p>

<p>As she lay down, she said sighing, "Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
likely, this is the last Night I shall pass
in this dear little Bed."</p>

<p>I said, "Shall you be sorry to leave us?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I shall!" cried she; "you
have been Kindness itself to me; even my
Illness was solaced, and my Recovery
has been very pleasant; but my Life
in Servitude is anything but comfortable.
I have heard or read a Line somewhere:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>And</i> Betty's <i>praised for Labours not her own</i>.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In <i>my</i> Case, the Reading might be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>And</i> Gatty's <i>blamed for Blunders not her own</i>.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It cannot be helped. Good Night!"</p>

<p>"I hope," said I, "we shall never quite
lose Sight of one another."</p>

<p>"Oh no! I hope not. You must write
to me now and then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can come to us when you
have a Holiday."</p>

<p>"I never have a Holiday. Lady <i>Betty</i>
knows I had no Friends when I came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Town, and does not approve of my
making any."</p>

<p>"No Friends! That does sound dreary!"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> dreary."</p>

<p>I had now extinguished the Candle.
She said no more; but I could hear her
from Time to Time give a great Sigh.</p>

<p>"<i>Gertrude</i>," I at length said softly, "are
you crying?"</p>

<p>She cleared her Throat a little, but
made no Answer.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Dear, what's the Matter."</p>

<p>"I'm only a little low," she replied,
huskily.</p>

<p>"How I wish I had given you some
reviving Drops, before I put out the
Candle! I will light it again."</p>

<p>"Oh no! Drops would do me no good&mdash;they
would not give me what I want."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you want?"</p>

<p>"To see my Mother once more, and
my Brothers, and my Sisters, and every
one at Home. I do pine for them all
so, you can't think!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>And now she sobbed outright, though
quietly. "It seems so long since I came
away, and the Prospect before me is so
forlorn; no certain Hope of going back;
or ever, ever seeing them any more!"</p>

<p>"<i>Gertrude</i>, I <i>shall</i> get up and give you
the Drops. They will give you Strength."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they won't."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will. You have over-tired
yourself to-day; you are trying to get
about too soon. The Drops will quiet
you and set you to sleep, and to-morrow
you will be better."</p>

<p>So I gave her the Drops, which she
thankfully took; and in Half-an-hour or
so I was glad to find she was asleep.</p>

<p>The next Morning, while we were
dressing, as she had quite recovered her
Composure, I took Advantage of what
might be my last Opportunity to question
her a little more than I had yet done on
her Position at Lady <i>Betty's</i>.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "'tis not good to
complain, I know, but however, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
this once say Somewhat of my Life
behind the Scenes, with as few Notes
and Comments as I can. My first
Grievance is sleeping with that <i>Frenchwoman</i>,
a low Person whom it is impossible
to like. I wake sooner than she
does, and avail myself of it for a little
quiet Reading or Needlework on my
own Account before she is stirring. But
first, I light the Fire in the little Closet
beneath my <i>Lady's</i> Chamber, put down
the Irons, and warm some Coffee for
<i>Pompon's</i> Breakfast and mine, which she
takes in an uncomfortable Sort of Way,
running in and out half dressed, without
ever sitting down, so that my Breakfast
is uncomfortable too. Then I have to
iron out every individual Thing that
Lady <i>Betty</i> took off Overnight, even to
her Gloves; and to air her clean Linen.
Having then fed her Parrots and cleaned
their Cages, (<i>Pompey</i> has the Monkey
and Lapdog in Charge,) I sit down to
fine Work, and have scarce set a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Stitches, when Lady <i>Betty's</i> Bell is pulled
as if the Wire would crack, and her
High-Heeled Slipper raps the Floor to
let me know she is ready for her Chocolate.
<i>Pompey</i> brings it up to the Door,
and I carry it in, and wait on her while
she drinks it. After this, she remains
in Bed two Hours, sometimes sleeping,
but oftener sitting up propped with Pillows,
doing any Fancy-Work she is in
the Humour for, getting me to thread
her Needle, change her Silks, hold her
Scissors, and Sometimes to read a Novel
to her. If she is very late, it may
chance that one of her female Cronies
arrives in her Chair, runs up to tell her
some Piece of Gossip, and perhaps
rouses her to get up and dress in a
Hurry to go to some Auction; in which
Case she needs not so much two Waiting
Women as twenty. But oftener, she is
uninterrupted, and after wasting half the
Morning, rises to waste the other half in
a lengthened, capricious Toilette; trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on a dozen Things she does not mean to
wear, and studying what Colours suit
her Complexion. As she does not so
much as put on her own Gloves herself,
Madame <i>Pompon</i> is on hard Duty all
this While, I standing by and handing
her the Pins and Everything she wants.
If my <i>Lady</i> thinks herself in good
Looks, all the better for us; but if she
spies out so much as a Freckle, woe
unto us! we are sure to suffer for what
we can't help. To put her in good
Humour, <i>Pompon</i> flatters her to a Degree
that is nauseous to me, and sometimes
gets a Rebuff for her Pains: then I am
set to write half-a-dozen trivial Notes to
her Dictation, or perhaps the Invitations
to a Rout or a Drum, which <i>Pompey</i> is
then summoned to carry out. Then, my
Work is called for to be examined; I am
chidden if I have not done enough, and
receive numerous Orders and Counter-Orders
about it. At last, my <i>Lady</i> goes
out in her Chair, during which Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I keep close to my Needle, and then
<i>Pompon</i> and I dine together. Lady <i>Betty</i>
returns, receives Visitors, and I am on
Duty as Woman in waiting, to bring her
Scent-Bottle, hold her Handkerchief, her
Gloves, and hear the News and Gossip
of the Day and a thousand Impertinences.
At length my <i>Lady</i> dines: then
I resume my Needle; then she dresses
for the Evening, which is as tedious a
Transaction as her Morning Toilette.
Her Dressing-Room is the loveliest, most
luxurious Apartment you ever saw; at
first I thought it Fairy-Land, and did
not mind being shut up in it; but oh,
how tired I am of it now! Its Silken
Draperies, polished Mirrours, Spider-Tables,
Ivory Caskets, Alabaster Vases,
Silver Footbath, old Porcelain, grotesque
Toys and delicate Trinkets give me no
more Entertainment than so much Rubbish.
Elaborately dressed, she goes forth
not to return till two, three, or four
o'Clock in the Morning. Madame <i>Pompon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
goes down Stairs to play Cards, or puts
on her Calash and goes out to see her
Friends, or if she stays with me, nods
over a <i>French</i> Novel, or babbles all kinds
of Nonsense while she manufactures some
Piece of Finery. Meanwhile, I sew and
sew at that eternal Embroidery, or try to
keep myself awake with a Book, if I
can find one to my Mind, till my <i>Lady</i>
returns jaded or excited from the Ridotto,
to be undressed and have hot Soup in Bed.
Thus, you see, I have no Change, no Exercise;
and what is worse, no Food or
Medicine for the Mind; and oh, <i>Patty!
is</i> this a Life for an accountable Creature?"</p>

<h3><i>Lady Betty's Fright.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"However</span> that may be, <i>Gatty</i>," said
I, "'tis certain you and I have not the
Power of rectifying Abuses, and must
take Things as we find them; but you
must console yourself with thinking your
Trial will probably not be long, for I'll
wager a Pound you'll be married within
the Twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"Who to?" says she, opening her Eyes
wide.</p>

<p>"Nay, I can't tell that," said I, "but
you are not the Sort of Girl to be overlooked."</p>

<p>She smiled sadly and said, "You are
only speaking at Random, nor have I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
any Wish to be married, any further than
I should like almost any Condition better
than my own. But now, tell me, <i>Patty</i>, is
it not a bad State of Things when young
Women are so placed as that they are
tempted to look to Marriage as an
Escape?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it is," said I; "but yet,
<i>Gatty</i>, let me tell you, your Condition
might be many Degrees worse than it
now is. Nay, if you had been born
and bred to Servitude, you might even
consider you had a tolerable Place; 'tis
your gentler Birth and Bringing-up that
makes the Collar so hard to wear.
Suppose, for Instance, Lady <i>Betty</i>, in
addition to her Caprice and Frivolity,
had the Sufferings, Infirmities, and confirmed
Ill-Humours of old Age? Or
suppose she were married to a troublesome
Husband? Or, even as she is,
that she were a Martyr to some irritating
Complaint?"</p>

<p>"Then I would nurse her with Pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and Patience," says <i>Gatty</i>. "However,
'tis no use supposing this and the other&mdash;I
must take my Lot and make the best
of it; only I sometimes envy the Shop-Girls
behind the poorest Counter, for
methinks they have more Exercise and
Variety, and have at least their Sundays
to themselves; whereas, 'e'en Sunday
shines no Sabbath-Day to me.'"</p>

<p>I had a Word on my Lips as to what
the Shop-Women might have to say on
the other Side of the Question; but Time
pressed, and I was obliged to run down
Stairs to see the Milk sent out.</p>

<p>After Breakfast, Mr. <i>James</i> the Footman
made his Appearance in Undress
Livery, carrying a small Trunk, and requested
to see Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>. When she
appeared, "Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>," says he&mdash;"dear
me, how you've fallen away! you must
have been ill indeed!... I was about to
say, your Billet to my <i>Lady</i> threw us
into sad Confusion Yesterday. I carried
it to her on a Salver, and she, not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
who sent it, opened it carelessly,
when, seeing your Name, she dropped
it like a red-hot Coal, and fell back on
her Settee, crying to me to throw the
Billet in the Fire. But then called me
back to bid me look in it first, and see
what you said, she smelling to her Scent-Bottle
all the While. When I told her
<i>Ladyship</i> the Contents, she said she would
by no Means have you back yet, it
would be highly dangerous, and perhaps
cost many precious Lives; that you had
better go down somewhere into the
Country, to your Home, in short, till
you got thoroughly disinfected; and
after that she would let you know her
Mind about you. So I have brought
your Trunk, and your Half-Year's
Wages; and here are five Pounds to clear
off your Expenses here and pay for your
Journey into the Country."</p>

<p>I never saw a Face light up with Joy as
<i>Gatty's</i> did, that Moment! "Oh, this is
delightful!" said she, "Thank you kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>James</i>, for being the Bearer of such
good Tidings! I have little Doubt that
I shall be quite strong and well after
spending a Month at Home, and then I
will do as my <i>Lady</i> pleases."</p>

<p>When the Man was gone, she pressed
the five Pounds on my <i>Mother</i>, with the
humblest Expressions of Gratitude; but
my <i>Mother</i> would by no Means take it.
At length it was decided to inclose three
Pounds in a Packet to Dr. <i>Elwes</i>, not to be
sent to him till <i>Gatty</i> was gone; and the
other two would pay her Journey, outside
the Coach, to her native Place, so that my
Lady <i>Betty's</i> Bounty but just cleared Expenses.</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> was now in the gayest Spirits, and
whereas she had hitherto seemed rather a
quiet Girl, she was now talking incessantly.
There was Something moving in witnessing
the Joy she experienced in looking forward
to seeing her Mother, and the Glee with
which she spoke of her little Brothers and
Sisters, the Dog, the Cat, the most trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Thing connected with Home. For Instance,
"<i>Pussy</i>," she would say, "you are
handsomer than our old Tortoiseshell; and
yet I would not exchange old <i>Tibby</i> for
you." "How glad <i>Towler</i> will be to see
me! I fancy him at the Gate, wagging
his Tail. He is deaf, and has lost most
of his Teeth, but I hope he is not so
blind but what he will know me again."</p>

<p>As her Luggage was but light, I made
her find Room for a small but very rich
Plum-Cake, a present from my <i>Mother</i>
to hers, and also some Gingerbread-Nuts
for the Children.</p>

<p>In the Afternoon, a Boatman stepped
into the Shop with some Boat-Cloaks, saying
that Mr. and Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i> were
coming up from the Water-Side to take
Tea in our Gardens. I knew not the young
Gentleman was married; and indeed he
was not so, but his Companion proved to
be his Aunt; the quietest, sweetest-looking
old Lady I ever set Eyes on. The Sky
having clouded over, we had little Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that Afternoon; I set their Table in our
nicest Arbour, and had Pleasure in serving
them myself, and providing them with the
freshest <i>Shrewsbury</i> Cakes and lightest
Buns. They seemed on the pleasantest of
Terms together; the young Man's Attention
to the old <i>Lady</i>, without fulsomeness,
was very agreeable to see; and their Conversation
was somewhat above the common
Run. Towards the Conclusion of their
Repast, a Rain-Shower came on, which
alarmed Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>, and made her
request Shelter in the House. I instantly
shewed them into our Parlour; where
<i>Gatty</i>, having finished her Packing, was
embroidering an Apron which <i>Prue</i> had
commenced for my <i>Mother</i>, but had got
tired of before it was half done. <i>Gatty</i>
was such a superior Needlewoman that her
Work, besides being done so quickly, put
<i>Prudence's</i> quite to shame; the Leaves,
Flowers, and Sprigs seemed to grow under
her nimble Fingers. Old Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>
watched her a little While, admiring her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Facility; and then raising her Eyes from
<i>Gatty's</i> white Hands to her almost as
white Face, "You look very delicate,
young Woman," says she.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ma'am, I'm a great deal better
now; almost well," says <i>Gatty</i>, scarcely
looking up.</p>

<p>"Have you been very ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam, I have had a Fever."</p>

<p>"This is the young Person, Aunt," says
Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>, "whom I mentioned to
you as having been taken ill, the Day of
Lady <i>Betty's</i> Folly."</p>

<p>"And are you going to return to Lady
<i>Betty</i>?" says Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>.</p>

<p>"No, Madam, I am going Home To-morrow;
into the Country."</p>

<p>"The best Place for you, Child. Are
you going into Service no more?"</p>

<p>"I wish it were so, Madam," said <i>Gatty</i>,
hemming away a Sigh.</p>

<p>"I should think Lady <i>Betty's</i> Place
too hard for you; she goes out a good
deal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Hours try me, Madam. I have
been used always to go to Bed early."</p>

<p>"How early?" put in Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock, Sir."</p>

<p>"And now?&mdash;at Lady <i>Betty's</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not till Two or Three in the Morning;
sometimes Four."</p>

<p>He shrugged his Shoulders, and drew in
his Breath.</p>

<p>"My Dear," remonstrated Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>
gently, "I am not sure we have
any Right to inquire into the Details of
her <i>Ladyship's</i> Household."</p>

<p>He smiled, and looked brimfull of
Questions he wanted to ask.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some other Employment
might be found less injurious to your
Health," resumed the old <i>Lady</i>. "You
seem a skilful Embroidress. That Pattern
is charming; I should like to have it."</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy to copy it for
you, Madam," said <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p>"Alas, Child, I could not work it if
you would give it to me, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
gave me your Eyesight too! But I'll tell
you what you might do for me. You
are going into the Country, you say.
Probably you will there have Leisure to
work on your own Account."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Madam!"</p>

<p>"Work me a Set of Aprons, then, as
your Time and Strength permit; I will
Pay you for your Trouble when they are
finished; but here is Something for the
Muslin and Silks, which I will get you
to supply."</p>

<p>And she put Money into her Hand.</p>

<p>"I think I have some prettier Patterns
than this up-Stairs, Madam," cried <i>Gatty</i>;
and she flew up-Stairs, without at all regarding
the Trouble of unpacking her
Box to get the Patterns, which were at
the very Bottom, in order to lie flat.</p>

<p>"There is Something very well-spoken
and obliging about her," said Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>
to me. "Is she of respectable
Condition?"</p>

<p>"Her <i>Father</i>, Madam, was a Country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Curate, and died, leaving a large young
Family unprovided. Her <i>Mother</i> is a
distant Relation of Lady <i>Betty's</i>. <i>Gatty</i>
became Lady <i>Betty's</i> Maid, because no
better Independence offered to her, and
she wanted to assist her <i>Mother</i>."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut! This is a sad Story&mdash;Surely
Something more suitable might
be found."</p>

<p>"You spoke of an Embroidery-Shop,
Madam&mdash;<i>we</i> thought of that too, as
<i>Gatty</i> is so clever, and can design as well
as execute Patterns; but my <i>Mother</i>
thought it would expose such a pretty,
unprotected Girl, thoughtless and ignorant
of Evil, to many Temptations we
had not taken into the Account."</p>

<p>"The Clouds are breaking, now, Aunt,"
said Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>, returning from the
Garden-Door, where he had been apparently
watching the Weather, but very
likely hearing none the less of what was
said. "I think we may shortly venture
to return."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Presently, my Dear. The young
Person has gone to fetch me some
Patterns."</p>

<p>"By-the-by, Ma'am, would not such a
young Person as Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> be very
useful to you in the Parlour, writing
your Notes, threading your Needles, and
making Tea for you? Mrs. <i>Rachael</i> is
getting past Work now, and is not much
of a Companion."</p>

<p>"My Dear, I have thought of it myself,
but we will do Nothing hastily. At
present we will let Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> go Home
to recover her Health and make my
Aprons."</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> at this Moment reappearing, no
more was said, except about the Patterns,
which occasioned more Debate than Mr.
<i>Arbuthnot</i> could reasonably be expected to
listen to as patiently as he did. But perhaps
he was thinking of some other Matter
all the Time. After this, they went away.</p>

<p>Though there was now not much Daylight
left, <i>Gatty</i> knew she should match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the Muslin and Silks so much better in
Town than in the Country, that she resolved
on going out to buy them; and I,
to have all of her Company I could, went
with her. The Walk was a long one, but
our Spirits made us insensible of Fatigue,
and the Weather after the Shower was
delightful. In the Evening Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
reappeared, though not to Tea, and asked
us what he should read. "Oh, something
cheerful, please, Sir!" cried <i>Gatty</i>
hastily, which made us all laugh; but she
said she had no Mind to cry again before
she went Home. So he read to us about
Sir <i>Roger de Coverly</i>.</p>

<p>At Night <i>Gatty</i> was in such a nervous
Fidget, she could scarce keep still. She
kept saying, "I hope to Goodness I shall
not over-sleep myself! Don't let me
over-sleep myself!" I told her there was
no Danger, for I always could wake what
Time I chose in the Morning, if I resolved
on it overnight; and I had already resolved
I would wake, and wake her, at Five. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
told her I meant to see her off. She said,
"Oh, don't!" I said, "Yes, I shall&mdash;I want
to see the Last of you, so it's no Use
speaking. Otherwise you may miss the
Coach, and be returned on our Hands
like a bad Penny." She laughed, and
said, "It is quite insincere of me to pretend
to wish you not to go, for I wish to have
you with me to the very Last; only it is
such a Shame to give you so much
Fatigue and Trouble." I said, "People
who really care for one another, don't
mind Fatigue and Trouble. Would not
you do as much for me?" "Yes, to be
sure I would," says she.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said I, "say no
more about it, but let us get to Sleep as
fast as we can."</p>

<p>It was quite Dark when we got up
next Morning, but every one was up, to
see <i>Gatty</i> off. We all insisted on her
making a hearty Breakfast, and she declared
that every Morsel seemed to stick
in her Throat; so that it was "most Haste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
worst Speed." <i>Prue</i> put her up a large
Packet of Sandwiches and Biscuits, saying
she would find her Appetite by-and-by;
and my Mother pinned her Handkerchief
closer at the Throat, bidding her beware
of Cold. I thought there would be no
End to her Leave-taking.&mdash;When she had
kissed all round, she began again. "Am
not I to come in for my Share, Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i>?" says my <i>Father</i>, who was
eating an Anchovy. "Oh yes, Sir," says
she, laughing, and colouring a little; and
kissed him too.</p>

<p>"That's right," says he; "you're one
of the right Sort&mdash;frank, without being
forward&mdash;A thorough nice Girl, out and
out&mdash;I wish the World were full of
People like you."</p>

<p>"Thank you for all your Kindness,
Sir," says she.</p>

<p>"Pooh," says he, "I've shown you no
Kindness; the Women have, I grant
ye; all the better for both Parties."</p>

<p>"Come, <i>Gatty</i>," said I, "we shall lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Coach." So off we set, with <i>Peter</i>
carrying the Trunk.</p>

<p>When we reached the <i>Old Angel Inn</i>,
a noisy Bell was ringing, enough to deafen
one; and a Man blowing a Horn out of the
Window. The Coach was already at the
Door, and a Porter was shoving a very fat
Woman into it, to the apparent Disgust of
a Gentleman wrapped in a Roquelaure,
who was already withinside. Then the
Porter handed the old Woman a Dram-Bottle,
and a Puppy-Dog tied up in a red
Handkerchief. A thin, tall Gentlewoman
in a velvet Hood and green Joseph next
followed; and two rough-looking Men
got in last. On the Coach-Roof were
two Men hallooing and wanting to be off.
In the Basket, where <i>Gatty</i> was to go,
was an old Woman smoking a Pipe. We
took our last Kiss&mdash;a hearty one, and our
last Look&mdash;a cheerful one; she scrambled
up into the Basket, which was a very
awkward Appurtenance, and the lumbering
old Coach drove off, rocking and swaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from Side to Side like a Ship in a Gale of
Wind. Going under the Archway, one
of the Men on the coved Roof of the
Vehicle got a severe Rap on the Head.
He hallooed out pretty loudly, but his
Voice was drowned by the Horn.</p>

<h3><i>A Voice from the Basket.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I reached Home, a drizzling Rain
began to fall, which I was very sorry for on
<i>Gatty's</i> Account.</p>

<p>In the Course of the Evening, Dr. <i>Elwes</i>
called. He said, "What could that young
Baggage mean by sending me her three
Pounds? I give them in Charge to you,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, to remit to her, since I don't
know her Address."</p>

<p>I said, "You are very kind, <i>Doctor</i>,
but Lady <i>Betty</i> is well able to remunerate
you."</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, hang Lady <i>Betty</i>&mdash;I don't
return the Money to her, but to Mrs.
<i>Gatty</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "Mrs. <i>Gatty's</i> Pride
will be hurt."</p>

<p>"And have I no Pride, neither?" says
he. "I am not accustomed to take Fees
of a Lady's Maid."</p>

<p>So, as I saw it was to be so, I said no
more, except by Way of Thanks in <i>Gatty's</i>
Name; and resolved to remit her the
Money as soon as I received a Letter from
her.</p>

<p>The Letter was not long a-coming. I
have it before me now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">"Larkfield, Hants.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: right">"Sept. 14, 1749.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">"Dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>,</p>


<p>"Your last Look said so plainly
that you should like to hear a Voice
from the Basket, that I have taken the
largest Sheet of Paper I can find, to tell
you about my Journey Home, and how
happy I am. About Half-an-hour after
we started, it began to rain pretty fast,
which incommoded me more than my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Companion, as she covered her Head
and Shoulders with a piece of Sacking,
from which the Rain ran down upon
me. When we changed Horses, the
Men inside got out to stretch themselves,
and I then observed that the Passenger
in the Roquelaure was Squire <i>Heavitree</i>,
the Father of a Gentleman Farmer in
our Neighbourhood whom we know
pretty well, and who was doubtless on
his Way to visit his Son and have a little
Shooting. He, pitying me in the Rain,
stepped up and said, 'Young Woman, if
my Roquelaure will be of any Service....
Why, <i>Gatty</i>! is it you? Art going
Home, Child? There's Room inside
the Coach for thee.... Come down,
come down from the Basket, I'll pay
the Difference!' And, almost whether
I would or no, he made me alight and
get into the Coach, where I had to ride
bodkin between him and the fat Woman
with the Puppy-Dog. At first I was
very glad to be sheltered from the Rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but the Coach was very close, and we
had only one Window partly open. The
<i>Squire</i> chatted so cordially with me,
however, that I had little Time to think
of Disagreeables; and when he had told
me all he had to tell, he fell to questioning.
Most of the Passengers were nodding,
which was all the better, as I did
not like mentioning Names before Folks.
By-and-by, the <i>Squire</i> became quiet,
and I guessed he was going to nod too;
but, stealing a Look at him, I saw he
was only thinking. We were now going
slowly over a heavy, sandy Road, and
the Coach rocked a good deal, and
sometimes stuck. I feared once or twice
we should be overturned; but the <i>Squire</i>
said, 'No Danger;' and, to divert my
Attention, pointed out a Gibbet across
the Heath, on which a Highwayman
hung in Chains; no very pleasant Object.
As I looked somewhat apprehensively
towards it, suddenly the open Window
was blocked up by a Horseman with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
black Crape over his Face, who, crying
'Your Money or your Lives!' fired straight
through the Coach, so as to shatter the
opposite Glass. The next Moment,
another Highwayman appeared at the
other Window. There's no describing
the Noise, Uproar, and Confusion, the
Smoke, Stench of Gunpowder, shrieking
of Women, and barking of the Puppy.
The next Moment, our stout old <i>Squire</i>,
disengaging a Blunderbuss from its Sling
over our Heads, presented the Muzzle
full at the Highwayman who had not
yet fired, and sprang out of the Coach
with it; on which, the Man galloped up
the Bank, stooping low, so as to keep his
Horse's Neck between his Head and the
Piece; at the same Time dropping his
Pistol, which was secured to his Waist
by a leathern Strap. He called to the
Postilion who rode our third Horse,
'Drive on!' 'No, stop,' cries the <i>Squire</i>,
'for I see another Coach coming up,
which may contain an unarmed Party!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
The Highwayman, reiterating, 'Drive
on!' galloped across the Heath, followed
by his two Companions; for a <i>third</i> had
been at our first Horse's Head all the
While. The <i>Squire</i> continued levelling
his Piece at them as long as they were
within Range, then took off his Hat,
wiped his Head, and turned about to us
with a Look of Satisfaction. The other
two Men, who all this While had been
as white as Death and as still as Stones,
now cried, 'Well done, <i>Squire</i>! we're
much indebted to you!' while the outside
Passengers gave him three Cheers.
He took mighty little Note of them, but
stepped up to the Coach that had now
come up, which proved to contain the
Duke of <i>Newcastle</i>, who, being unarmed,
was very glad to continue his Journey in
Company with us. Thus were three
Desperadoes put to flight by one energetic
old Man! In another Hour we
reached the Inn where we were to dine,
where the Duke parted Company with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
us. The <i>Squire</i> sat at the Head of the
Table, and made me sit next him, and
insisted on pledging all the Ladies, to
keep up our Courage. Every body
talked fast and ate fast too, as we were
elated at our Escape and pretty hungry.
I should tell you, the fat Woman maintained
that her snappish little Puppy had
thrown the Robber off his Guard; but
the <i>Squire</i> shook his Head upon't.
While fresh Horses were putting to, a
couple of Horsemen, apparently a Clergyman
and his Servant, rode into the Inn-Yard.
The <i>Squire</i>, stepping out to
them, related what had just occurred,
and cautioned them against crossing the
Heath unarmed. They thanked him,
but told him they were two Police-Officers
in Disguise, and well armed in
the Hope of Attack. In fact, as we
have since learnt, they were beset by the
very Men who had assailed us, and
giving Chase to the Gang, who dispersed
as wide as they could, followed them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
across the Country till they succeeded in
capturing two; one of whom swam his
Horse across a River, but was taken on
the other Side. The <i>Squire</i> has since
been asked to appear against them, but
has declined, saying there is already sufficient
Evidence, and he has no Mind to
swear away Lives that he spared when
his Blood was hot.</p>

<p>"After this, you may suppose we could
talk of Nothing but Murders, Robberies
and such-like delightful Subjects during
the greater Part of our Journey: and
each seemed trying to outdo the other,
in hope of making the others forget how
tamely all had behaved except the <i>Squire</i>.
Gradually we dropped our Companions
at one Place or another, till none remained
but the <i>Squire</i>, myself, and the fat
Woman. He now began to be amused
at the Joy I could not help betraying at
the Sight of every well-known Landmark,
and tried to tease me by supposing a
Dozen ridiculous Accidents that might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
have happened at Home, to disappoint
me of my Pleasure. At length, we
stopped at the Corner of a By-Road in
<i>Larkfield</i> Parish, and young Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
comes up. 'Are you there, <i>Father</i>?'
says he, scrambling up on the Step to
look in. 'All right, my Boy,' says the
<i>Squire</i>, grasping his Hand, which he
shook heartily, 'and here's <i>Gatty Bowerbank</i>
come Home to see her <i>Mother</i>.'
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> gave me such a cheerful
Smile! 'How glad they will all be!'
said he, 'they do not in the least expect
you, and have been wondering why you
have let them be so long without a Letter.
I was at your <i>Mother's</i> just now.'
'She's quite well, then?' cried I. 'Oh
yes,' said he, 'but <i>you</i> don't look very
well, I think.' 'Manners, <i>Jack</i>!' says
the <i>Squire</i>. 'Well, <i>Father</i>, I meant no
Harm; here are Horses, Sir, for you and
me, and a light Cart for your Luggage.'
'Put Mrs. <i>Gatty's</i> Baggage into the
Cart too, my Boy,' says the <i>Squire</i>, 'and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
send the Horses round to the <i>Green
Hatch</i>, for I've a Mind to walk across
the Fields with this young Damsel, and
see what Reception she gets, and I suppose
you won't Mind coming along with
us.' 'Not I, Sir,' said Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,
'I shall like it very much.' So, when
the Luggage was put in the Cart, and
the Coachman was settled with, we
started off, as sociable as could be, talking
about the Highway Robbery; and the
<i>Squire</i> took Care to tell his Son that I
was the only Woman who did not
scream when the Pistol was fired into
the Coach. Well, we got to the dear
old Garden-Gate; and there, strolling
along the pebbled Walk just within it,
were <i>Lucy</i> and <i>Pen</i>, their Arms about
each other's Necks.&mdash;The <i>Squire</i> hemmed;
they looked round; and oh! what
a Cry of Joy they gave! My <i>Mother</i>,
hearing the Noise, came out....</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, I am writing as
small as ever I can, and must write still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
smaller, if I mean to get in Half of
what I want to say. Imagine what a
happy Evening we had! My dear
<i>Mother</i> shed many Tears, though, when
she heard of your Kindness to me
throughout my Illness; and desired me
to express her Thankfulness to you all
in the strongest Terms I could frame.
My Ten Pounds proved very acceptable,
as it made up, with her Savings, just the
Sum she wants to bind <i>Joe</i> to our Village
Doctor. <i>Penelope</i> is learning to make
Bone-Lace; and Mrs. <i>Evans</i> is so well
content with <i>Lucy</i>, that she is going to
take her as second Teacher in her School
next Quarter, so that we are all getting
on mighty well, one Way and another.
Also my <i>Mother</i> has realized a pretty
little Sum by the Sale of some of my
<i>Father's Latin</i> Books, and there are yet
more left. Your delicious Plum-Cake
was done ample Justice to, and the Boys
declare there never were such Gingerbread-Nuts.
Now I have filled my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Paper to the very Edge, and yet how
much I have left unsaid! Put yourself
in my Place, and you will know all I
would say to you, and to dear Mrs.
<i>Honeywood</i>, and to <i>Prue</i>; not forgetting
Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>, to whom give my kind
Regards."</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>My <i>Father</i>, who was smoking his Pipe
whilst I read this Letter to him and my
<i>Mother</i>, presently said, "I see them all!"</p>

<p>"See who, <i>Father</i>?"</p>

<p>"Everybody in Mrs. <i>Gatty's</i> Letter&mdash;The
old Woman with her Pipe, the old
Gentleman in his Roquelaure, the Robber
hung in Chains on the lone Heath,
the Highwaymen, the stout old <i>Squire</i>
leaping out with his Blunderbuss, my
Lord <i>Duke</i> coming up, the Police-Officers
riding into the Yard, the young
Farmer coming to meet his Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<i>Gatty</i> flying up to her <i>Mother</i>&mdash;that
Letter is as full of Pictures as this
<i>Chinese</i> Paper."</p>

<p>After ruminating on it a While longer,
he began again, with:</p>

<p>"<i>Gatty</i> ought to marry the <i>Squire</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>Father</i>! his <i>Son</i>, if you please!"</p>

<p>"How do you know the Son is a single
Man?"</p>

<p>"Nay, how do we know the Squire is
a Widower? He's too old."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she won't marry either," said
<i>Prue</i>.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Mrs. <i>Prue</i>, but let me
tell you, neither you nor your Sister
could have writ that Letter."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Father</i>, I suppose a Woman
does not get married for writing a Letter.
For my Part, I don't see much in
it. Anybody, I suppose, could write, if
they had Anything to write about."</p>

<p>"No, that don't follow&mdash;it's a <i>non sequitur</i>,
as the Scholars say."</p>

<p>"I don't set up for a Scholar, not I,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
said <i>Prue</i>, "I never was so good a Hand
at my Pen as <i>Patty</i>; but I worked the
best Sampler, for all that."</p>

<p>"Well," says my <i>Father</i>, "say, when
you write to her, <i>Patty</i>, that I don't care
how often I pay a Shilling for such a
Voice from the Basket as that. I wish
she'd send us one every Week."</p>

<p>It indeed was Something curious, how
my <i>Father's</i> Fancy was hit by this Letter,
which he got me to read to him many
Evenings following. What was more remarkable,
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> praised it too,
though after a more temperate Manner.
He called it easy Writing. Now, sure,
what is easy, is not so meritorious as what
is difficult! And he added it was almost
as good as some of the Letters in the
<i>Spectator</i>; which, everybody must own,
was immoderate. <i>Gatty</i> could historify
plain enough what passed before her own
Eyes and was heard by her own Ears; but
she could not frame a Sentence that required
some Exertion of the Mind to follow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which, I take it, is the Perfection of good
Writing; at least, I know that's the Way
with our best Authors. And no Shame to
her for it: Women are not to be blamed
for not shining in what is out of their
Province; and she spelt perfectly well, and
wrote a neat, flowing Hand, which had
found Plenty of Practice under Lady <i>Betty</i>;
only, to set her up with the <i>Amandas</i> and
<i>Dorindas</i> that corresponded with Sir <i>Richard
Steele</i>; why, the Thing was clearly preposterous.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> continued to
find his Way down to us most Evenings,
with his Book in his Hand; and I must
say he made the Time pass very pleasantly
and swiftly; but though he read quite loud
enough for such a small Company, 'twas
evident to himself as well as to us, that his
Voice would by no means yet fill a Church;
besides which, his Breath soon became
short, and a red Spot would come on his
Cheek; which, whenever my <i>Mother</i>
noticed, she always made him shut his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Book, and would talk about Anything that
chanced, rather than let him over-tire
himself. Meanwhile, he heard Nothing,
as far as I could glean, of Mr. <i>Caryl</i>: I
know he got no Letters, nor received any
Visitor; and that, I think, tended to make
the red Spot infix itself on his Cheek.
I pitied him heartily&mdash;"Hope deferred
maketh the Heart sick"&mdash;but yet it was
a Matter I could not presume to express
Sympathy with him upon; nor was I
qualified to allay any of his Uneasiness.
But I kept anxiously looking out for Mr.
<i>Caryl's</i> entering the Shop. One Forenoon,
Lady <i>Betty's</i> Man, Mr. <i>James</i>, came in;
and, says he, "Your Servant, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>&mdash;My
<i>Lady</i> is going to give a grand Masked
Ball to-morrow Evening; and it occurred
to me that you and your Sister might
like to look on. If so, I can secure you
good Places, where you will see without
being seen; and you will only have to
come early, and ask the Hall Porter for
Mr. <i>James</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>I thanked him, and said it would be a
vast Treat to us; and after a little Talk
about Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>, and my offering him
some Refreshment, which he readily selected
in the Form of Cherry Brandy and
Macarons, he went away.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Lady Betty's Masquerade.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> was mighty pleased to hear of
our Engagement, as it would afford her a
near View of the gay World, which was
what she had long been desiring. After
the Shop was closed, we set forth, attended
by <i>Peter</i>, who was also to see us safe back;
and on reaching the Square, we descried
the House directly by the lighted Flambeaux.</p>

<p>Both the private and public Entrance
were already in Commotion; but we
asked the Hall Porter for Mr. <i>James</i>, who
presently appeared, still in Deshabille.
"You have taken me at my Word," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he smiling, "Your Coming is of the
earliest, and I dare not let you go up-Stairs
yet, so you must wait awhile in
the Servants' Hall, till the Company
begin to arrive."</p>

<p>I was never in a Servants' Hall of that
Description before; and I must say that it
afforded me Matter and Leisure for several
Reflections. Servants, Pastry-Cooks&mdash;Men
and Boys, and so forth, were bustling in
and out, and we were pushed about a good
Deal till we got into a quiet Corner behind
the Clock. It struck me that the
Pleasures of the Quality were purchased at
the Price of a good Deal of Immorality in
their Dependents. Many a Glass of Wine
did I see swallowed on the Sly; many a
Tart and Custard whipt off and hastily
eaten in Corners. One would have
thought, in a great House like this, Fragments
of Dainties had been so common
that they would have been no Temptations;
but doubtless the poor Servants had
been so overwrought and debarred of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
natural Rest and regular Refreshments,
that their Strength required a little keeping
up, for they had an arduous Evening
before them. The Maids flirted and
jested; the Men used intemperate Language;
in and out among them all sailed
my Lady Housekeeper from Time to
Time, as proud as a Dutchess, and in a
Head and Primers that a Dutchess had
probably worn, before they were a little
soiled.</p>

<p>By-and-by the Bustle increases. Mr.
<i>James</i> comes in, superbly attired, and
smilingly offers us Tarts and Tokay; but,
though pressed, we declined. Then he
beckoned us to follow him, and piloted us
into a brilliant Ante-room where, behind
some huge Orange Trees in Wooden Tubs,
he found us Seats that commanded a Vistoe
of the two Drawing-rooms beyond.
Sure, the <i>King's</i> Majesty could scarce dwell
in greater State. I think that neither
<i>Whitehall</i>, <i>Windsor</i>, nor <i>Hampton Court</i>
could ever have made a greater Show.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The Ante-Chamber Hangings were blue
Velvet and Silver, the Drawing-room that
came next beyond was amber Satin and
Gold; the Chamber beyond that was hung
with Goblin Tapestry. Also there were
some large Mirrours, in which one might
behold one's self from Head to Foot.</p>

<p>I had very little Notion of what a
Masked Ball was really like, but I concluded
the Company being attired as
Monarchs, Roman Senators, and Potentates
of various Descriptions, would be
sufficiently possessed with their imaginary
Dignities to display Gestures and Deportment
of a corresponding Sort, which
would doubtless be very majestical. And
these again would be relieved by Light-Comedy
Parts, which, well supported,
would be humorous and diverting.</p>

<p>As, let People assemble as late as they
will, some one must still be first, so it was
on the present Occasion. A little Man,
gaudily attired, entered with a good Deal
of Flutter and Importance, who, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he found the Apartments empty, exchanged
his Strut for his ordinary Gait, took off his
Mask and put it on again several times,
perambulated the Saloons, peeped into
everything, examined himself again and
again before the Mirrours, acted a little in
Dumb-Show, sat down before one of them,
and finally curled himself up on a Settee
and dropped asleep.</p>

<p>I wonder how much the Expectation of
Pleasure makes up the real Amount of
Pleasure apportioned to us in this Life.
The Pleasure itself continually disappoints;
the Expectation of it has often Something
troubled and impatient; so that either Way
there's perpetual Alloy.</p>

<p><i>Prudence</i> and I were now mighty
anxious for the Company. A Group at
length entered, consisting of Maids of
Honour and Courtiers of Queen Elizabeth's
Time, very much furbelowed and
bedizened, who believed themselves the
first till they espied the little Man on the
Settee, when there were some small Jokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
made about <i>Cymon</i> and <i>Iphigenia</i>, <i>Milton</i>
and the <i>Italian</i> Lady, Sleeping <i>Beauty</i> in
the Wood, and so forth. Then the Ladies
settled their Ruffs at the Mirrours, and
sailed up and down; and one of them
walked through Part of a Minuet without
Music with a Gentleman she called Sir
<i>Christopher Hatton</i>, who pointed his Toes
extremely well. Then one of them said,
"My Mask makes my Face so hot!"
"And red too," said the other; "but
what will it be by-and-by?" "I wonder
if <i>Harry</i> will come," says one; "I'll lay
any Wager I shall find him out."&mdash;"I'll
lay any Wager you won't," says the
other. Thought I, is this the Way Maids
of Honour used to talk in the Days of
good Queen <i>Bess</i>? Well, perhaps it may
be.</p>

<p>Just then the little Man woke up, rubbing
his Eyes, and saying drowsily, "<i>John</i>,
my hot Water at seven ..." on which
the Ladies tittered, and he woke up,
looked about, and probably felt foolish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Now the Musicians came, and took their
Places, and began to tune up; and <i>Prue</i>
whispered to me, "How delightful!"
Indeed, the Music was, or seemed to me,
first-rate, and I enjoyed it as much as anything;
yet at length became inured to it,
and scarce more attentive than to a common
Street Band; and finally wished the Men
would not play so loud, for it prevented
my hearing what People were saying.
The Ball-Rooms now began to fill fast;
and were soon crowded with <i>Jews</i>, <i>Turks</i>,
and <i>Saracens</i>, Nuns, Monks, and Friars,
Goddesses, Shepherdesses, and Milkmaids,
Pulcinelloes, Mountebanks, and Ministers
of State. Their Dresses were excessive
fine, and I almost trembled to think of the
Expense People had put themselves to for
the Amusement of one Night; however,
that was all for the good of Trade&mdash;if so
be they paid their Bills.</p>

<p>As for supporting their Characters, there
was scarce an Attempt at it; the utmost
that the greater Part of 'em did was to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in little squeaking Voices, "You don't
know me!" "I know you!" This
seemed to me stupider than Child's-Play;
and I was beginning to weary of it, when
<i>Prudence</i> jogged me as a very pretty Figure
passed, in striped Gauze and pink Satin,
sprinkled with Flowers, as the Goddess
<i>Flora</i>; and whispered, "Lady <i>Grace Bellair</i>."</p>

<p>Soon after, a smart young <i>Spanish</i> Cavaliero
came in, whom she pronounced to be
Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>; and a Bashaw with three
Tails, whom she decided upon as Sir
<i>Charles Sefton</i>. Whether any of her
Guesses were right, I knew not. By-and-by,
Dancing began in the inner Saloon;
and, for the first Time, I had a
Glimpse of Lady <i>Betty</i>, who was the only
Woman without a Mask; and when I saw
how great was her Advantage therein over
the rest, I wondered how Persons that
evidently thought mainly of outward Appearances
could make themselves such
Frights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>By-and-by a singular Couple, Arm in
Arm, left the Ball-Rooms for the Ante-Chamber,
dressed like <i>Charles</i> the Second's
Courtiers, all but their Heads; for one had
the Head of a Fox, and the other of a
monstrous Goose. The latter said, "Quack!"
whenever he was pushed by the Crowd,
which was held an exceeding good Joke,
for Folks cried, "Well done, Goose!
Quack again!" and, when he did so,
went into Peals of Laughter. At Length,
with his Friend the Fox, he sat down on
a Bench just in Front of our Orange-Trees,
exclaiming to his Companion,
"Precious hot Work! Even Popularity
may be too fatiguing."</p>

<p>"I never had enough of it to know
that," says the Fox.</p>

<p>"You! Why, you've been steeped in it
to the Lips!&mdash;among a certain Coterie
at any Rate. You are feigning Modesty,
Mr. Fox."</p>

<p>"All I said was, I had never had too
much; perhaps, not enough. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
belong to an insatiable Race. By-the-by,
I proved myself a Goose To-Night in
choosing to play Fox, for you are by far
the more popular."</p>

<p>"And only by saying Quack."</p>

<p>"Quackery goes a great Way in this
World,&mdash;I might have known 'twould
be so."</p>

<p>"Monstrous fine Masquerade this!"
said the Goose.</p>

<p>"Oh, delightful! Have you made out
many People?"</p>

<p>"Why, to tell you the Truth, I've been
so observed myself, I've had no Time to
observe others."</p>

<p>"Quack!"</p>

<p>"Sir! name your Hour, Place, and
Weapon."</p>

<p>"How quiet and retired is everything
in this little Spot! You have Time to
observe now."</p>

<p>"Why did you deny yourself to me
Yesterday? I know you were at Home."</p>

<p>"The Truth is, I was desperately hypped."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"What made you so?"</p>

<p>"Study."</p>

<p>"What were you studying? The natural
History of the Fox?"</p>

<p>"No, I was learning some Verses by
Heart; and I'll spout them to you."</p>

<p>"Now then; don't be tedious."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>Three Things an Author's modest Wishes bound;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My Friendship, and a Prologue, and ten Pound.</i>'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, come! that's <i>Pope</i>!"</p>

<p>"Well, and it's my Case too&mdash;pretty
near. A callow Poetling writes a Piece,
dedicates it to me, and expects me to
patronize and print it."</p>

<p>"You? Why, I never saw your Name
head a Dedication!"</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, you may shortly&mdash;if I find
no Way of adroitly declining the Honour,
as I have done similar Favours
before."</p>

<p>"Why decline?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, the Thing's burthensome."</p>

<p>"The ten Pounds may be; but most
People consider themselves honoured,
and are willing to pay for an expensive
Luxury."</p>

<p>"Well, it's no Luxury to me."</p>

<p>"Don't have it, then."</p>

<p>"How avoid it?"</p>

<p>"By simple Neglect. He can't <i>ask</i> for
the ten Pounds, if you forget to send
them."</p>

<p>"No, but he may abuse me."</p>

<p>"If his Abuse is not clever, Nobody
will read it. Come, you are making a
Mountain of a Molehill. If he has
sent his Poem to you, send it back 'with
Thanks,' or forget to return it altogether,
or let a Spark fall upon it."</p>

<p>"Then a Spark would fall upon <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Nay, if none of those Expedients can
fit you, you must help yourself to one.
I begin to think you ought to have played
Goose, in good Earnest."</p>

<p>They now fell to talking of the Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and criticizing their Dresses and
Deportment, but I was too preoccupied
with what they had been saying to attend
much to their caustic Remarks; for though
they spoke quietly, and their false Heads
somewhat disguised their Voices, I could
not help entertaining an Impression that
the Fox was Mr. <i>Caryl</i>. Was it poor
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, then, he alluded to so unhandsomely?
Oh, the Hollowness of
Worldlings! Why, had I not with my
own Ears heard him commend Mr.
<i>Fenwick's</i> Poem to his Face, and thank
him for the Compliment of the Dedication?
And yet, here he was waiving it off, as
'twere, and even hinting that Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
wanted to be paid for it! whereas I
knew he had refused Money when offered!
Oh, the Meanness!... He was
jealous, and envious too, I could make out,
of a Man that had writ better Verses than
his own; and would fain have them supprest.
Well, well, this is a wicked World
we live in; and that's no News neither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>A false Head and a false Heart, thought
I, as the Fox walked off with the Goose.
I declare my Hands tingled to pull off that
Fox's Head and expose him; but that
would have been witless. I got tired of
the Vanity-Fair long before <i>Prudence</i> did.
At length even she had had enough (and
no Wonder, for our Attention had been on
the full Stretch for many Hours, without
Refreshment or Change of Posture); but
the Difficulty was, how to steal away; for
the Lobbies and grand Staircase were as
thronged as the Ball-Rooms, and we
could not in our plebeian Dresses, and unmasked,
attempt going among the Company;
so there we continued to sit, long
after we wanted to come away. At length
the Rooms began to thin; and we took
Advantage of a chance Dispersion of the
Company to make a sudden Flight to the
back Stairs. I thought I heard Remarks
and Exclamations made, but never looked
round; and there, at the Foot of the back
Stairs, stood <i>Peter</i> as pale as Death, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he had missed us, and never should find
us. He had passed the Night, of course,
at a Public-House&mdash;no good place for him,
nor for scores of others that did the same;
and was now waiting with our camelot
Cloaks and Clogs, which he had stowed
safely somewhere where he knew he could
find them again. Once equipped, we followed
close at his Heels as he elbowed his
Way through a Rabble-Rout of Chairmen,
Link-Boys, Hackney-Coachmen, Pickpockets,
and Lookers-on. It was pouring
of Rain, the Pavement shone like Glass, Day
was breaking, and I never heard such an
uproar in my Life.... "Lady So-and-so's
Chariot!" echoed from one hoarse Voice
to another all along and round the Corner;
and then "Lady So-and-so's Chariot stops
the Way!"&mdash;till Lady So-and-so stepped
in and drove off.</p>

<p>At length we got quit of it all, and
picked our Way Home as we best could,
and a long Way it seemed! We had too
much to do in minding our Dresses, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Leisure for talking. As we got towards
the <i>Five Fields</i> we met plenty of Market-Carts;
and now and then we heard the
shrilly Cry of some poor little Chimney-Sweep.
Once at Home, we were soon in
Bed and asleep; and I awoke nearly at my
usual Time, chilly and yawnish, but <i>Prue</i>
continued sleeping, and I did not wake her.</p>

<p>I was not down quite as soon as usual,
after all, and the Milk and Bread were
behind Time; and, of Course, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
did not get his Chocolate as soon as usual.
When he heard what had made me late,
he looked grave. I said, "Sure, Sir, there
was no Harm in looking on?" He said,
"Well, I don't know.... It is dangerous to
attend not merely Places of pernicious
but of doubtful Amusement. Do not
your Feelings this Morning tell you that
there was Something unsound and unsafe
in the Revelry of last Night? And
if so in the Case of mere Spectators, how
much more in that of actual Participators?
and of all those poor People, no voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Promoters of it, who only obeyed
Orders, and got no Pleasure at all, but
what was allied to Dishonesty and Intemperance?
I don't want to be overstrict;
but am I right or wrong, think
you, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>?" And I was obliged
to own that I believed he was in the Right
on't.</p>

<p>As for <i>Prue</i>, she was fit for Nothing all
Day; but she would hear of no Wrong
in what had to her been so delightful. So
I left her to amuse my quiet <i>Mother</i> with
her lively Chat, and attended to the Shop
myself.</p>

<h3><i>Tom's Presents.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> sitting behind the Counter, when
a smart-looking, sunburnt young Man of
about two-and-twenty, attired as a Sailor,
came into the Shop. He said, "Hallo,
<i>Patty</i>! how are you?" I said, "Why,
<i>Tom</i>! can it be you? I thought you
had been in <i>China</i>!"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> been there," says he, "true
enough; more-by-Token, here's a <i>China</i>
Orange for you;" and clapped one into
my Hand with such Force that it went
near to go through it.</p>

<p>"How are you all?" said he; "I'm glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to see you, and I hope you're glad to see
me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, very glad, <i>Tom</i>; pray walk
into the Parlour&mdash;we are all at Home."</p>

<p>"How are you, <i>Uncle</i>?" says he, so
loud and sudden that he made my Father
jump. "And you, <i>Aunt</i>!"&mdash;kissing her.
"And you!" kissing <i>Prue</i> too.</p>

<p>"'Manners, <i>Jack</i>!'" says my Father,
quoting <i>Gatty's</i> Letter.</p>

<p>"My Name's <i>Tom</i>, <i>Uncle</i>, not <i>Jack</i>,
though I suppose you meant <i>Jack Tar</i>.
Well! so here you all are! I've only
just landed&mdash;Didn't forget one of you
in foreign Lands; I've brought my <i>Aunt</i>
a Monkey."</p>

<p>"A nasty Beast!" cries my <i>Father</i>;
"we won't have him here, <i>Tom</i>! He'll
break all my China."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Uncle</i>, I thought she <i>might</i>
do a little Damage that Way, ('tis the
prettiest little Creature you ever saw;
her Ears are bored, and her Name's
<i>Jessy</i>!) So I brought you, Sir, a Tea-Service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to cover Breakages; the Cups
and Saucers fitting into each other; and
the Teapot, no bigger than this Orange,
fitting in o' Top; the whole Concern
packs in a Cylinder no bigger than a
Spice-Box."</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Tom</i>," says my <i>Mother</i>, nervously,
"we've more Tea-Services already than
we should know what to do with, if we
did not keep a genteel Kind of Tea-Garden
for the Quality."</p>

<p>"But as you do, Ma'am, won't it be
acceptable? Or otherwise, won't you
want <i>Jessy</i> to break it? She's the
prettiest little Dear you can imagine, the
Darling of the whole Ship. Well! it
seems you're each discontented with the
other's Presents;&mdash;my <i>Uncle</i> don't like
your having the Monkey, and you don't
like his having the Crockery. Then
I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;chop and
change. I'll take your Presents down
to my <i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i>, and you shall
have theirs. I've bought <i>you</i> a Pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Slippers, <i>Prue</i>, but of course they're too
big."</p>

<p>And out he pulled a Pair of little
<i>Chinese</i> Slippers that might have pinched
<i>Cinderella</i>.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you can't wear them, <i>Prue</i>,"
said I.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shan't try," said she, jerking
her Chin.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Patty</i>, since I could find you
Nothing better, I've brought you a
Feather Fan with an Ivory Handle."</p>

<p>"Thank you, <i>Tom</i>!" said I; "it will do
nicely to flap the Flies off the Pastry."</p>

<p>"And since you, <i>Aunt</i>, will not have
the Monkey, you must be content with
some Gunpowder Tea."</p>

<p>"I shall like that a great deal better,
<i>Tom</i>, I assure you. The only Sort of
Gunpowder I approve."</p>

<p>Here <i>Tom</i> pulled out of his Pocket
what looked like a Mahogany Rule, about
nine Inches long. "Now, Sir," says he
to my <i>Father</i>, "what's that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't for the Life of me tell," says
my <i>Father</i>, after eyeing it askance and
then handling it.</p>

<p>"I knew you couldn't! See," (unfolding
it,) "it's a Boot-jack!"</p>

<p>"A queer one, <i>Tom</i>!"</p>

<p>"And what is it now? Why, a Reading-Desk!
What is it now? A Cribbage Board!"</p>

<p>"Ha! <i>Tom</i>, that's ingenious."</p>

<p>"Ingenious, <i>Uncle</i>? I believe it is!
What is it now? A Ruler. What is it
now? A pair of Snuffers."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew you'd laugh&mdash;what is it
now? An eighteen Inch Rule. What is it
now? A Pair of Nut-crackers. What
is it now? Two Candlesticks. What is
it now? A Picquet-Board. What is it
now! A Lemon-squeezer. That's for
you, <i>Uncle</i>. That's all the Changes.
It will go into your Coat Pocket."</p>

<p>"It <i>shall</i> go there, <i>Tom</i>! 'Tis a real
Curiosity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you'd say so, Sir. I wasn't
sure about the Monkey, but I knew
you'd like this. <i>Jessy</i> shall go with me
Home, but I shan't go there till next
Week, because they don't know we've
come up the River, so I shall stay a
little here first."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Tom</i>, I don't know how we can
take you in, for we have a Lodger."</p>

<p>"Oh my Goodness! Nay, don't put
the poor Fellow to Inconvenience on my
Account, pray."</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" cried <i>Prue</i>, indignantly.
"Why, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> is quite a
Gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is he so?" said <i>Tom</i>, bursting out
laughing, "and pray, what am I? 'Sir,
you're no Gentleman!'&mdash;is that it,
<i>Prue</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, you're <i>Tom</i>, and that's all."</p>

<p>"And that's enough too, isn't it? Oh,
I can swing my Hammock anywhere.
I wouldn't put Anyone to the smallest
Inconvenience. Would sooner catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
my Death of Cold, or lose every Shot
in my Locker."</p>

<p>"<i>Tom</i>, you're such a thoughtless, good-tempered
Fellow, we must pack you in
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, <i>Uncle</i>! don't think of it.
I'll be off to the <i>Three Bells</i>. Only,
there are two Belles here I like better."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Tom</i>, I shouldn't like you to get
your Pocket picked."</p>

<p>"And I," said my <i>Mother</i>, "should not
like you to take your Death of Cold."</p>

<p>"Never caught Cold in my Life, Ma'am,
that was only Flummery; a Sailor has
Something else to do than keep sneezing
and blowing his Nose. And I can leave
my Money and Watch here."</p>

<p>"<i>Prudence</i>," said I, "you and I could
sleep in the little blue Closet."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't <i>Tom</i>," said <i>Prudence</i>,
"now the other Door is un-nailed? We
should have to move all our Things."</p>

<p>"Thank you, <i>Patty</i>," said <i>Tom</i>, "you
were always as sweet as Syrup to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I shall like the blue Closet a precious
deal the best, I can assure you, instead
of being mast-headed."</p>

<p>So thus it was arranged; and the light-hearted
Fellow was soon established among
us, spinning long Yarns, as he called them,
about <i>John Chinaman</i>.</p>

<p>The next Day, he was absent for some
Hours, and when he came back, he said
he wanted <i>Prue</i> and me to go with him
in the Evening to see a Conjuror. <i>Prudence</i>,
for some Whim, would not go; but
I accompanied him with Pleasure. The
Way <i>Tom</i> went on, however, spoiled my
Evening's Entertainment.</p>

<p>The Conjurer was dressed somewhat in
the Oriental Style, and I should have taken
him for a real Foreigner, only that <i>Tom</i>
whispered to me that was all Sham. In
Fact, he began by addressing us in very
good <i>English</i>, and saying that the Marvels
he was about to display were unaccompanied
by any Fraud or Deception, and
that any Lady or Gentleman who doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
his Word might come and sit at his Elbow.
"I accept your Invitation!" cries <i>Tom</i>;
and immediately "slued himself round,"
as he expressed it, round a Pillar between
us and the Stage, slipped down it as if he
had been a Monkey, and was at the Man's
Side in a Moment. The Conjurer looked
sufficiently annoyed, but not more so than
I felt, for it seemed to me that the Eyes
of all the Audience were alternately on
<i>Tom</i> and me, as indeed they well might be.
Luckily for my Comfort and Respectability,
he left me sitting next to a very
steady-looking elderly Couple, the nearest
of which said, "Never mind, young Lady,
we'll take Care of you." I said, "It was
so very thoughtless of him to leave me!"
and felt quite uncomfortable. "It <i>was</i>
very thoughtless," said the good Woman's
Husband, smiling, "I should think, Miss,
he's in the sea-faring Line." I said,
"Yes, Sir," and we then began to attend
to what was going on, on the Stage; but
I sat on Thorns all the While.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tom</i>, quite unembarrassed by the Publicity
of his Position, kept his Eyes fixed on the
Conjurer's Proceedings with an Air of
lively Interest. The two or three first
Tricks drew from him such Exclamations
as "Capital! Excellent!" which appeared
somewhat to mollify the Cunning Man;
but at length, when Something was done
which seemed very surprising, <i>Tom</i> coolly
remarked, "Ah! I see how that is managed,"
in a Voice as clear as a Bell, that was heard
all over the House. The Conjurer shook
his Head at him and frowned; but went
on to Something else. Again <i>Tom</i> was
pleased; again he clapped as heartily as
any. The next Trick he marked his
Approval of by saying, "Very neat, very
neat." At Length came the grand Feat
of the Evening, which was swallowing a
Carving-Knife. Everybody's Attention
was riveted, when <i>Tom</i> said in an Expostulatory
Voice, "But, my dear good
Fellow, how can you say there is no
Fraud or Deception?" "Sir, I defy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you to prove any," says the Conjurer.
"I will prove it directly," says <i>Tom</i>, "for
I have often seen the Thing better done
in <i>India</i>." "Sir, you are an impertinent
Fellow," says the Conjurer; "I must
insist upon it that you withdraw. If
you will not retire of your own Accord,
you shall do so on Compulsion, for it is
highly indecorous to interrupt a public
Performance in this Manner."</p>

<p>"Well, but why did you ask me?" said
<i>Tom</i>. "I didn't!" says the Conjurer.
"You did," says <i>Tom</i>. "<i>Didn't</i> he?" to
the whole House. "Knock him down!
Throw him over!" cried several Voices.
"Give him into Custody!" "Nay," says
<i>Tom</i>, "I don't want to make any Disturbance:&mdash;if
you wish me to go, I'll go,
for I never like to put People to the
least Inconvenience, and I'm sure if I'd
known you didn't mean to be taken at
your Word, I would have stayed where
I was!" Saying which, he swung himself
up the Pillar again, and was by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Side the next Moment, looking as merry
and good-tempered as ever. But I was so
penetrated with Shame, that I could not
bear to look up, but begged him to let us
go Home, to which he acceded, though
with much Surprise. The next Morning,
I was giving my <i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i> an
Account of my uncomfortable Evening,
when <i>Tom</i>, coming in to Breakfast, says,
"Who is that pale, lanky Chap I met
just now upon the Stairs?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tom!</i>&mdash;" said <i>Prudence</i>, very indignantly,
"it was Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>!"</p>

<p>"How should I know who he was?"
rejoined <i>Tom</i> unconcernedly, "I thought
he might be a Thief."</p>

<p>"A Thief, indeed!" muttered <i>Prue</i>, as
she buttered her Roll.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Prue</i>," said he briskly, "I gave
<i>Patty</i> a Treat last Night, so now it's
your Turn."</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i> give <i>Patty</i> a Treat, indeed,
my Lad," says my <i>Father</i> ironically.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she found it so, <i>Uncle</i>," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
he, quite cheerfully, "so, To-Night, <i>Prudence</i>,
I'll take you to the Play."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I want to go," says
<i>Prudence</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh! very well, then I'll take <i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>"Thank you, <i>Tom</i>," said I, "but I
don't quite approve of Theatrical Amusements."</p>

<p>"You don't? Oh my Goodness!&mdash;And
do <i>you</i> disapprove of them, <i>Prue</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, not I," said <i>Prue</i>, "I think <i>Patty</i>
more nice than wise."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, come along like a good Girl,
and let's go together."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Tom</i>," says my <i>Father</i>, "I shall
put a Spoke in that Wheel, unless you
promise you won't forsake her as you
did <i>Patty</i> last Night."</p>

<p>"I'll promise you a Dozen Times,
<i>Uncle</i>, if you think that will make it
more secure."</p>

<p>"No, if you promise once in earnest,
that will do."</p>

<p>"I do promise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, <i>Tom</i>," put in my dear <i>Mother</i>,
"I share <i>Patty's</i> Objections to the Play-House,
and I think two such young
Heads as you and <i>Prue</i> are hardly to be
trusted there. In short, I would rather
she did not go."</p>

<p><i>Prue</i> pouted a little on this&mdash;My <i>Father</i>
began to chafe.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks, my Dear," says he, "you
and I often went to a Play together
when we were young, and why shouldn't
they?"</p>

<p>"Why, my Dear, as I am no longer
young, I see Things in a different Light."</p>

<p>"It may not be a truer Light, though,
Mrs. <i>Honeywood</i>, and you can't expect
young Folks to see Things differently
from what you yourself did when you
were young. Tut, tut! let the Girl go,
and say no more about it."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. <i>Honeywood</i>...."</p>

<p>"But, Madam!" (very loud and angry,)
"haven't I said it should be so, and have
I a Right to be minded?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Here my <i>Mother</i> turned pale and trembled,
which I never could bear to see; and
I was going to urge <i>Prue</i> and <i>Tom</i>, in a
low Voice, to give up their Treat rather
than foment a Family Quarrel, when I
was called into the Shop, which prevented
my knowing how the Matter ended. Presently
<i>Tom</i> went through the Shop, out of
the House; and the next Time I could
look into the Parlour, it was empty.</p>

<p><i>Prue</i>, however, was singing about the
House, so I argued that Peace had been
restored somehow; most likely by her
giving up the Play. By-and-by she comes
in all Smiles, and says, "I'll take up Mr.
<i>Fenwick's</i> Chocolate," and, before I could
say a Word, took the little Tray out of
my Hand and was off with it.</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about this, when,
some Time after, happening to go up
Stairs for my Knotting-Bag, in passing the
open Door of Mr. <i>Fenwick's</i> Sitting-Room,
I saw him and <i>Prue</i> standing at the Window,
their Backs towards me, in earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Conversation; he holding her by the Hand,
and she apparently in Tears. This gave
me the oddest Feeling I ever had in my
Life&mdash;I went up into my Room, sat down
on the first Chair I came to, and could
hardly turn my Breath. I could not think
what had come over me! Presently I got
up and tried to drink some cold Water,
but could hardly get it down. It seemed
to me as if I could not <i>think</i>; and yet
there was a great, dull, dark, unwelcome
Thought in my Head all the while!</p>

<p>I leant my Head against the Wall; and
having quieted myself a little, rose to go
down Stairs. Just then, <i>Prue</i> came in,
and looked as if she had hoped to find the
Room unoccupied. I said, "You've been
crying, <i>Prue</i>!" She said, sharply, "No,
I haven't!&mdash;and what if I had?"&mdash;I
said, "Only that I should have been sorry
to know that you were in Sorrow." She
said, "Tears are shed for Joy, sometimes,
as well as Sorrow, are not they?" "Certainly,"
said I; and turned away. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i>could</i> make you think I had been crying,
<i>Patty</i>?" says she hurriedly. "Well,"
I said, "I thought you might be vexed
about the Play."&mdash;"The Play? oh, that
was given up before <i>Tom</i> went out," said
she&mdash;"Of course it <i>did</i> vex me, and I
think it was unkind of my <i>Mother</i> not
to let me go." "You know her Motives
are always kind," said I. "Well,
of course I do," says she, still crossly,
"but don't harp any more on such a disagreeable
Subject. If you do, I shall
run away from you." And away she
ran.</p>

<p>Then it was not the Play; then it was
not about Anything connected with <i>Tom</i>,
that had made her cry! I'd thought as
much! "Tears are shed for Joy as well
as for Sorrow," sometimes, though not
very often. I sat down again, and turned
my Face to the Wall, with my Head
resting against it, and cried bitterly. Mine
were Tears of Sorrow, not of Joy!</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XI.</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Old Angel.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not much like to look back on that
Time:&mdash;I was under a Cloud; a very dark
one; and saw, heard, and felt Everything
under its Shadow. I did not seem to love
<i>Prue</i> much, nor to believe she loved me;
I took Pleasure in Nothing, and did
Nothing well.</p>

<p>I wonder, now, how I could have been
so silly. I am very glad People could not
see into my Heart, nor guess what was
passing in my tossed and fretted Mind.
Oh! if our Neighbours sometimes lay to
our Charge Things that we know not, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
often might they lay to our Charge Things
that they know not! They think us on
good and pleasant Terms with them, maybe,
when we are full of Envy, Jealousy,
and Suspicion. They utter the careless
Word and laugh the cheerful Laugh,
little guessing that their lightest Look,
Word and Tone are being weighed in a
Balance.</p>

<p>I suppose my troubled Mind tinctured a
Letter I wrote, at about this Time, to
<i>Gatty</i>; for in her Reply to it, which followed
very quickly, she said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think I can see by your Writing
that you are not well, nor in good Spirits.
How earnestly do I wish, dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>,
you would come down to us here, and try
the effect of a little Change. Yours is a
very toilsome, anxious Life, though you
carry it off so well; always afoot, always
thinking of others! But this may be
overdone, and I think you have overdone
it now; so come down, pray, before you
get any worse. You know your Way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the <i>Old Angel</i>, dear <i>Patty</i>! and though
the Days are so very short now and the
Weather cold, the Roads are in fine
Order and you shall have a warm Fireside.
My <i>Mother</i> will be more joyed
to see you than I can express, and so will
my <i>Brothers</i> and <i>Sisters</i>, and I need not
say how acceptable your Company will
be to me! My Month's Holiday is up,
and I have writ to Lady <i>Betty</i>; but she
returns no Answer, and perhaps considers
me no longer her Servant. I cannot say
I shall fret much if it prove so; but the
Fact must shortly be ascertained; as in
that Case I must seek another Service.
How I should like to go to that reverend,
comfortable old Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>! Perhaps,
when I send her Aprons, I might
write a respectful Line, saying I am in
want of a Situation. Hers would be a
vastly different Service, I fancy, from my
Lady <i>Betty's</i>. And yet, do you know,
that strange <i>Sister</i> of mine, <i>Pen</i>, is certain
she should like to live with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
<i>Lady</i>! Dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, I must abruptly
conclude, as we are preparing to spend
the Evening at <i>Roaring House</i>. It is a
good Step, and there will be no Moon,
but we shall do well with Lantern and
Pattens, and are not fear'd at <i>Hob-Goblin</i>.</p>

<p>"I depend on your coming, so name the
Day; and wrap up very warm, or else
come inside the Coach. Tell the
Coachman to set you down at the Mile-Stone,
just before he reaches the <i>Green
Hatch</i>; and we will be there to meet
you. There have been no Highway
Robberies these three Weeks, and only
one Overturn, so don't be afraid."</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Affectionate,<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">Gertrude Bowerbank</span>."<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"<i>Roaring House</i>," slowly repeated my
<i>Father</i>, knocking the Ashes out of his
Pipe, when I had read him the greater
Part of this Letter. "It must be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
queer Place, I think, that has such a queer
Name.... A roaring House!&mdash;hang
it if I should like to live in it!&mdash;A
House that roars, or that has been accustomed
to roar, very likely in the old
Days of the roaring Cavaliers!&mdash;A
monstrous queer Name indeed!&mdash;Aye,
aye, many a Hogshead of strong Ale
has been swilled in its great, rambling
Kitchen by roaring Boys, I warrant ye&mdash;A
great, rambling, scrambling, shambling
House, with Doors and Casements
loose on their Hinges, that creak in the
Wind, and with loose Tiles on the great
gabled Roofs, and Swallows' Nests in
the great, windy Chimneys, and creaking
Boards in the uneven Floors and
rotten old Staircases, and dark Corners,
and dark Cup-Boards, and windy Key-Holes
and winding Passages. That's
my Notion of <i>Roaring House</i>."</p>

<p>"Is that where <i>Gatty</i> lives?" said
<i>Prudence</i> heedlessly.</p>

<p>"No, where she was going to drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Tea; with Lantern and Pattens," said
my <i>Father</i>&mdash;"Didn't you hear <i>Patty</i>
read? Ha! Time was, I wouldn't have
minded being her Foot-Boy."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Patty</i>," said my dear <i>Mother</i>
anxiously, "she does not think you are
well, Love. Do you wish to go to
<i>Larkfield</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, <i>Mother</i>, it would be
a great Treat; only I don't see how I
could well be spared."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can spare you well enough,"
cries <i>Prudence</i>; "you won't be missed!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I abruptly; and
thought I would not go.</p>

<p>"We will manage to spare you very
well, my dear Love," said my dear
<i>Mother</i>&mdash;"We will contrive so that you
shall not be missed."</p>

<p>Just the same Thing, only said how
differently! I thought I <i>would</i> go. A
kind Word spoken in Season, oh! how
good is it!</p>

<p>In short, I decided to go, for I felt I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
wanted a Change; and I was hourly in
dread of saying in my present irritable
State, something to <i>Prudence</i> which I
should afterwards be bitterly sorry for. I
saw she wanted me to go; I knew she
<i>could</i>, if she <i>would</i>, supply my Place for a
little While; and I hoped after a short
Absence to return with a new Set of Ideas,
and find all Things straight.</p>

<p>So I wrote to <i>Gatty</i>, to name my Day,
and began to pack up. When Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
heard I was going, he looked very
much surprised; but said Nothing. I was
glad of the one and the other. I liked
his being surprised, and I liked his making
no common-place Speeches. In the mean
Time, he had, I knew, addressed a Letter
to Mr. <i>Caryl</i>; and I found, rather unexpectedly,
he had got an Answer;&mdash;in this
Way.</p>

<p>I had carried up his Chocolate, and
found him with his Elbow on the Mantel-Piece,
and his Thumb and Fore-Finger
pinching his Chin very hard, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
frowned anxiously over a Billet he was
reading.</p>

<p>"This is very strange,&mdash;very provoking!"
cried he, looking round to me
for Sympathy&mdash;"I don't know why I
should trouble you to hear about it,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>, but I am vexed!"</p>

<p>"I should like to hear about it if you
please, Sir," said I quietly.</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;the Matter is this. I sent
Something I had been writing,&mdash;Something
I had taken a good deal of Pains
with,&mdash;to Mr. <i>Paul Caryl</i>. He seemed
a good deal pleased with it, took it up
quite warmly, promised to put it in
Train for me and give it his Patronage.
A long Interval has ensued, without
Anything coming of it; at length I venture
to write him a gentle Reminder;
and he, with a hundred thousand Protestations
and Apologies, writes to say
that 'how to excuse himself he knows not,
but the plain Fact is, a Spark falling on my
Manuscript, has utterly consumed it.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" cried I with sudden
Passion, "I don't believe one Word of
it!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's hard to believe&mdash;" begins
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> with an aggrieved Air.</p>

<p>"It's not to be believed!" interrupted
I vehemently; "it's a Falsehood, if ever
one was told! A trumped up, vamped
up Story!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, I can't hush, I know it's as
I say: I'm sure of it! Oh, the Meanness!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear <i>Patty</i>!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's abominable, Sir! <i>He</i>, call himself
a <i>Gentleman</i>?"</p>

<p>"My dear <i>Patty</i>, you quite astound me
by the Vehemence of your Sympathy.
I can't tell you how gratefully I feel it.
But your undue Warmth makes me see
my own in its proper Light&mdash;I was feeling
this Matter too much. It is mortifying
enough, I must own, but I dare
say what he tells me is true...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a Word!"</p>

<p>"And whether true or not, the Loss to
<i>me</i> is the same&mdash;I shall never see my
Manuscript again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I were the <i>King</i> or the <i>Lord Mayor</i>,
you should!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! what, when it's <i>burnt</i>?"</p>

<p>"Burnt or unburnt; or he should go to
<i>Newgate</i>; that he should!"</p>

<p>"No, no, <i>Patty</i>; Kings and Lord
Mayors don't send Poets to <i>Newgate</i>,
for being careless of other Poets' Papers.
You make me laugh at my own Annoyance,
you caricature it so! I have quite
cleared up, now&mdash;I shall not think of
it again; unless with a Smile. But I
heartily thank you for your warm Sympathy,
dear <i>Patty</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>Patty</i>, for your acceptable, your
<i>salutary</i> Sympathy."</p>

<p>And he cordially pressed my Hand. I
withdrew it, and slipped away; but with
a Feeling of Consolation and Complacence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to which my lone Heart had of late been
a Stranger. I wiped away a Tear, and
went to pack my Box.</p>

<p>"In a brotherly sort of Way," thought
I; "he regards me kindly. Nothing more."</p>

<p>Oh! what awful Work it is, when
Sisters are jealous of one another! The
nearer the Heart, the greater the Smart.
The closer the Kin, the greater the Sin.
My Heart was in that State, that the least
Injury, real or supposed, made me ready
to cry out; and yet I must look out
jealously for new Injuries, as if I had not
enough already. As for <i>Prue</i>, she was in
a most unpleasant Humour, snappish and
reckless, or merry and unfeeling: laughing
twice as much as there was Need, at the
merest Trifle; or requiring to be spoke to
twice before she heard or made Answer.
There was no Confidence between us now;
and if she had made any Approach to it,
I should have started away from it. I was
glad when she was going about, Sightseeing,
with <i>Tom</i>; for, as she truly said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
she was so soon to have all the Work to
do, that she might as well take her Pleasure
while she could: only it was not
spoken kindly. As for <i>Tom</i>, he had been
Home and back again: he had taken down
his Monkey to his Mother, but had soon
got tired, I fancy, of country Quiet, (which,
he said, was as dull as a Roari-torio,) so
made an Excuse to run up to Town again
on some sea-faring Business. However,
he had only left Home for a few Days,
and meant to return to it as soon as he had
squired me to the <i>Old Angel</i>; though I
told him I had not the least Need of his
Protection, and wanted Nobody but <i>Peter</i>
to go with me. He would not have it so;
but got up some Hours before Light, brisk
as a Lark, to see me off, like a good-tempered
Fellow as he was. He talked
all Sorts of Rhodomontade by the Way,
that amused me in spite of myself; and,
just as we got to the Inn-yard, asked me
how often I thought he had been in Love.</p>

<p>"Never once," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, there you're quite out," said
he, "for I've been in Love four Times."
Here a Man ran against him with a <i>Box</i>.
"You might have put out my Eye," says
<i>Tom</i> to him; "however, as you didn't,
it's no Matter." Here we got to the
Booking-office, and waited there while the
dirty old Coach was being washed.</p>

<p>"Four Times," repeated <i>Tom</i>, returning
to his Subject, "and I'll tell you who
with."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said I, "pray spare me!"</p>

<p>"You don't guess the Name of the
last, then," says he with a roguish Air.</p>

<p>"<i>Patty Honeywood</i>," doubtless, said I.</p>

<p>"You're not so far out, then," says he,
bursting out laughing.</p>

<p>"Hush, <i>Tom</i>! People will hear you...."</p>

<p>"Well, and what if they do?"</p>

<p>"Why, I shan't put much Faith in your
Passion, if you talk and laugh so openly
about it."</p>

<p>"Ah," says he, "perhaps I may feel as
much as Fellows that are more affected."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we got shoved about a good deal by
People coming into the Office. At length,
the Horn began to blow and the Bell to
clang over our Heads. <i>Tom</i> put me inside
the Coach, within which was as yet only
an old Lady in a red Cardinal. Then he
stood on the Step, and kept talking to me
through the Window. "Yes," says he,
"the Letters P. H. are indelibly tattooed
on me. Why won't you give a Fellow a
little Encouragement to live upon while
you're away?" Here he screwed up his
Face into a very mysterious Expression, as
much as to say, "The old Gentlewoman
can't understand me," and the next Moment
was showing his good white Teeth
from Ear to Ear in a broad Smile.</p>

<p>"They've slued up your Box now,"
says he, "and are getting under weigh.
There's a blue <i>Peter</i> to the Fore."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, the <i>Admiral's</i> Flag clapped to
the Foremast, for sailing Orders. What
I mean now, is, that your Man <i>Peter</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
looking Blue with Cold, is standing at
the Fore Horse's Head, and staring, as
well he may, at the Postilion. Well,
you won't carry much Ballast this Time.
There are some Barrels of Oysters in the
Hold, going down to Country Cousins
that have sent up Geese and Turkeys."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I wish I had thought of
a Barrel of Oysters," said I.</p>

<p>"Too late now!" said <i>Tom</i>. "But yet,
if you wish it, I'll make a Rush for
them, and come up with you along the
Road. You won't make more than
three Knots an Hour. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you. It's too late
now."</p>

<p>"Better late than never. And apply
that to me on the Present Occasion.
Come, accept me! Arn't I a very good
Boy, for a Sailor? You've never seen
me smoke, nor drink, nor fight, nor get
my Pockets picked, nor use any uncomfortable
Expressions. Oh no, I can't
bear to put People to the least Inconvenience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Here I am, going, going,
going,&mdash;say gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone!" said I; and he was off the
next Moment.</p>

<p>"A light-hearted young Sailor," says
the old Gentlewoman smiling, "I shouldn't
think many young Ladies would say 'No'
to the Offer he made you."</p>

<p>The Jumbling of the Coach over the
rough Stones precluded the Need of an
Answer. For some Time we journeyed
in the Dark; when Daylight came, I was
able to amuse myself with passing Objects;
and though the Cold was severe, I liked
Travelling very well. We stopped to dine
at Twelve o'Clock; there was a great, raw
Leg of boiled Mutton, which the old Lady
said was bad Meat badly killed and badly
cooked. She said, however, that Travelling
was improved since her young Days,
when the Coach was three Days going
from <i>London</i> to <i>Exeter</i>, and halted to observe
the Sabbath on the Road. We safely
reached the appointed Spot just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Dark, where <i>Gatty</i>, all Smiles and Cordiality,&mdash;and
a healthy, honest-looking Boy,
her Brother, were awaiting me. My Luggage
was so light, we carried it between
us, laughing and talking as we trudged
along to <i>Gatty's</i> Home; which I found
what she called "a good Step."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XII.</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Roaring House.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"Why</span>, <i>Gatty</i>!" said I, as we plodded
over the Moor, "I had no Notion you
didn't live in <i>Larkfield</i>!"</p>

<p>"But we do," said she, "in <i>Larkfield</i>
Parish. We live in the Foreign, though
not in the Borough. Didn't I ever tell
you that? When my <i>Father</i> died, we
gave up our Town-House, which was
twenty Pounds by the Year, and took
this, which is but fifteen."</p>

<p>It seemed to me a lonesome Situation
enough; however, a large, cheerful Family
prevents any House from seeming lonely;
and soon we were in a snug, well-warmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
well-lighted Room. They were all very
glad to see me; <i>Gatty's</i> Sisters were tall,
lanky Girls, nothing to compare in Point
of Looks with herself; but they seemed
very sociable and merry, and their <i>Mother</i>
was a quiet, kind-spoken Woman, whom
I should never have guessed for a Kinswoman,
however remote, of Lady <i>Betty's</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> and I slept together, and talked
a good Deal before we slept. She was
quite strong and well now, but seemed
more reluctant than ever to go back to
Lady <i>Betty</i>; and I thought she seemed
building on some vague Hope of getting
taken by Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot</i>. I could see she
liked her Country Home best of all, but
felt she had no Right to stay.</p>

<p>Next Day, we took a brisk Walk over
the hard frozen Ground. The Trees
being leafless, and the Sky threatening
Snow, I thought the Country had a dreary
Look with it; but the young People were
so gay that one could not be dreary in
their Presence; and we came Home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
our hot roast Mutton with red Noses, blue
Fingers, and tip-top Spirits. We were
to spend the Evening at <i>Roaring House</i>,
which I found was where Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
lived. All the Afternoon the Girls were
ironing clean Cuffs, and making cherry-coloured
Top-knots.</p>

<p>Though we started at Three o'Clock,
it was quite Dusk before we got to the
old Farm-House; but the ruddy Light of
a great Wood Fire through the Diamond-paned
Casements made it look cheerfully
enough. We had a hearty Country Reception
at the Threshold, from Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,
a mighty smart, good-looking young
Man, with quite the Air of a Country
Gentleman; and from his Sister, Miss <i>Clary</i>,
who was a few Years his elder, and who,
I had been told as I came along, was soon
to be married. There was no other Company
than ourselves, except Miss <i>Clary's</i>
Lover, and her <i>Father</i> the Squire, and the
Village Doctor's Assistant. We spent the
Evening in an old Stone Hall, with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
unpainted Girders over our Heads, sundry
old Brown-Bills and Bows against the
Walls, and a roaring Fire on the low
Hearth, which reminded me of the Name
of the House. We did not want Candles
for a good While; we sat about the Hearth
and chatted, and had Tea, and great Slices
of Plum-Cake; after that, we danced to
warm our Feet, the Squire playing the
Fiddle; and then we had Hide-and-Seek
and Hunt-the-Slipper, to please the young
<i>Bowerbanks</i>, and then each was called on
for a Song; and after that, we told Stories
of Ghosts, Murders, Robberies, hidden
Treasures, and such-like, till we quite
scared ourselves and one another. Then
the Squire would begin one and another
funny Story with, "I'll tell you what I
did when I was a Boy;" and he clapped
his Hands after every Song, and laughed at
every Story. I never saw an old Gentleman
take so hugely to young People; and
when nobody was minding him, he would
stand before the Fire with his Hands in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Pockets, humming "Oh, the Days when
I was young!" and hem away a Sigh.
We had Forfeits; and when young Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i> was bidden, "Bow to the prettiest,
kneel to the wittiest, and kiss whom
he loved best," he kneeled to me, and
kissed <i>Gatty</i>, which put her out and made
her very red; and I heard her say in her
quiet Way, "That's going too far." We
had Turkey and Mince-Pies for Supper,
and hot Elder-Wine and Toast afterwards,
to fortify us, they said, against the Cold.
The Squire wished he were young enough
to see us Home, but since he wasn't, <i>Jack</i>
would do as well. So Mr. <i>Jack</i>, that's
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>, went out to put on his great
Coat, and came back laughing, and said the
Ground was covered with Snow! And so
indeed it was, but we trudged through it
merrily enough. Next Day, however,
the Snow fell so fast all Day, that we were
kept in Doors, and <i>Gatty</i> worked hard at
Mrs. <i>Arbuthnot's</i> last Apron, till she finished
it. I wrote Home, it being the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Opportunity; for the Post only went out
of <i>Larkfield</i> three Times a Week: and that
was once oftener, Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> said,
than when she was first married.</p>

<p>There was much Conjecture bestowed
as to whether the <i>Heavitrees</i> would come
in the Evening to return our Visit, according
to Promise. <i>Gatty</i> thought they would
not; all the others thought they would,
and the two youngest Girls spent the best
of the Morning in making Cakes. The
young People came, without the Squire,
and we had a pleasant Evening, but not so
lively as the last, partly because the Parlour
was so much smaller than the Hall, and
partly because Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> was not so
convivial and humorous as the Squire.</p>

<p>After this, came two or three Days of
incessant Snow; and after the Snow, a Frost.
All were glad the Snow left off falling,
because we were expected at <i>Roaring
House</i>, and Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> said she could
not consent to our going if the Snow continued
to fall. So we made our Preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
full early; and meantime, a Servant
who had been into <i>Larkfield</i> and had called
at the Post-Office, among other Places, (it
being the principal Linen-Draper's and
Tea-Grocer's of the Town,) brought <i>Gatty</i>
a Letter from Lady <i>Betty</i>, which had been
lying there a Day and a Half, and the
Contents of which threw us all into Flurry
and Dismay.</p>

<p>My <i>Lady</i> wrote, in a very few Words,
by another Hand, to desire Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>
would return to her Duties <i>immediately</i>, for
that Madam <i>Pompon</i> had left.</p>

<p>This was a sad Blow to us all: poor
<i>Gatty</i> could not help crying; and we all
cried to keep her Company. Lady <i>Betty</i>
would not have been much flattered, could
she have seen the Reception her Letter
got. "Oh, poor <i>Gatty</i>! poor <i>Gatty</i>!"
resounded on all Sides; but after intermingling
Kisses and Tears, she was the
first to pluck up Courage, and say we
were only making Things worse by grieving,
and she would pack up at once, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ready for the Morning Coach, and then
think nothing more about it till the Time
came. So her Sisters dispersed, to dress
for our Party, and <i>Gatty</i> and I went up-Stairs
to do the same, and pack her Box;
several Times in the Course of doing which,
she burst out crying; and I thought I had
never beheld a Girl so loth to quit Home,
nor so resolved to do her Duty.</p>

<p>At length we set off; and when we got
to <i>Roaring House</i>, there was pretty much
the same Thing over again, for Jokes and
Laughing were exchanged for Lamentations;
and the Gaiety of the Evening was
completely clouded. I cannot help thinking,
however, that it was Balm to <i>Gertrude's</i>
Heart to find herself so unaffectedly sympathised
with: the Squire patted her on
the Shoulder several Times, and called her
"poor Girl," and "dear <i>Gatty</i>;" Miss <i>Clary</i>
more than once shed a Tear; and Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i> seemed quite mute and confounded.</p>

<p>We prolonged our Visit as late as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
could; and when we dared stay no longer,
the Squire and Miss <i>Clary</i> insisted on adding
many additional Wraps to our own;
he producing some prodigious large Silk
Pocket-handkerchiefs, which he tied himself
over our Heads and under our Chins,
like Capouchins, giving each a Kiss as a
Finish; and striving moreover to persuade
each of us to wear a Pair of his thick
Shoes over our own, and stuff up the
Difference between them with Rag and
brown Paper. While urging <i>Pen</i> to this,
his Son came in from the outer Hall,
looking deadly pale; and hit his Head
violently against an old Tortoiseshell-Cabinet,
which he ran against without
intending it.</p>

<p>"Measure your Distance better, <i>Jack</i>,"
says his <i>Father</i>, "or, what with black
Eyes and red Eyes, there won't be a Pair
of Eyes in the Hall worth looking at.
Bless thee, Child!" very kindly to
<i>Gatty</i>, as she stept up to bid him Good-bye.
"Keep thy good Heart and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Looks, whatever thou dost;" and so,
kissed her twice. <i>Gatty</i> dropped a Tear
on his Hand; he looked at it quickly, then
at her attentively; and giving her Hand
a final Shake, pushed her gently away, saying,
"There, go; go along; and <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Blessing go with thee."</p>

<p>By this Time we were all equipped.
Just as Miss <i>Clary</i> was kissing <i>Gatty</i> at
the Door, I noticed the Squire whisper a
Word in Mr. <i>Heavitree's</i> Ear, which made
the latter colour very much; adding to it,
"You'll be a Fool, if you don't do as I
say."</p>

<p>Now, we were all setting out from the
hospitable Threshold, the Lights streaming
from which illumined our Path till we
reached the Gate, which Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
held open till we had all passed. <i>Gatty's</i>
two younger Sisters, to show their Love
and Sorrow, were each monopolizing
one of her Arms and hanging upon her
as they followed <i>Joe</i>, who was taking the
Lead with a Lantern, though there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a pale Moon. Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>, therefore,
coming up as soon as he had fastened the
Gate, found me just behind the rest, and
spontaneously gave me his Arm; but the
next Minute, in a hurried Manner and
lowered Voice said, "Dear Mrs. <i>Patty</i>,
this once be my Friend. I've a Word to
say to <i>Gatty</i>, and those Girls will never
let me!"</p>

<p>I immediately said, smiling, "Trust to
me;" and in another Minute had dropped
his Arm and was walking off with
<i>Lucy</i>, and in two or three Minutes more
had secured <i>Penelope</i> too. As we walked
on briskly, <i>Pen</i> said, "Hadn't we better stop
for <i>Gatty</i>?" but I said, "No, she's close
behind, and Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> wants to have
a little Talk with her for the last Time."
This quite satisfied the artless Girls, who
soon were busy chattering about the Loss
of poor <i>Gatty</i>, and their Fears lest she
might not have a safe Journey. They
pointed out to me the North Star, and
<i>Charles's</i> Wain, and many other Stars or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Planets whose Names I forget, and told
me I might always know a Star from a
Planet, because Stars twinkle and Planets
do not. <i>Pen</i> even added that <i>Sirius</i>, the
Dog-Star, is sixty Times brighter than the
Sun, which I'm free to think must have
been a prodigious Blunder of hers. Who
can believe it? Except indeed, Children,
who swallow Incredibilities without any
Trouble.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Gate, we were surprised at
<i>Gatty's</i> coming up to us alone; yet I am certain
I had had a Glimpse of two dark Figures
following us the Minute before. Directly
we got in-Doors, all was Bustle. Mrs.
<i>Bowerbank</i> was sure we must be perishing
of Cold, and insisted on our going to Bed
directly; and promising to send each of us
a Basin of hot Gruel to eat in our Beds:
Gruel well qualified with Wine, Nutmeg,
and Sugar&mdash;Caudle, in Fact!</p>

<p>It was no bad Thing to be thus coddled
and comforted like Invalids while we felt
quite well; and we were soon undressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
as fast as we could. All but <i>Gatty</i>, who
came up to me when I was about half undressed,
to fetch a few Things she wanted,
and to tell me she was going to sleep with
her <i>Mother</i>. This was a Surprise and
Disappointment to me; I had reckoned on
a good Gossip over our Gruel, and on her
telling me all about Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> as soon
as the Candle was put out. However, it
seemed that the Thing had been settled,
even before we started, in order that I
might not be disturbed by her early Departure
the next Morning; and her Box
had already been carried down, and she
said she wanted to spend her last Night
with her <i>Mother</i>, so there was no more to
be said. I noticed, however, as she kissed
me, that her Eyelids were red with crying,
but her Eyes beaming under them very
bright. I said, "Good Night, but not
good-bye; for I am resolved to see you
off in the Morning." She said, "Oh,
you must not think of it. All will be
Bustle, and there will be no real Pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in seeing each other. I have quite got over
my Trouble at going, now, and don't
care at all about it." So she kissed me
cheerfully, and repeated, "Good-Night
and good-bye," and ran off. I was still
resolved to get up in Time to see the Last
of her; but I suppose the Caudle, being
so strong, made me sleep heavier and later
than usual; for though it was yet Dark
when I got up, I found on going down
Stairs that <i>Gatty</i> had been gone a full
Hour. None of the Family had accompanied
her except <i>Joe</i> and the Girl of all
Work, who carried her Box; but <i>Pen</i> told
me that just as she was watching <i>Gatty</i> out
of Sight by the Light of the Lantern,
some one joined them.</p>

<p>When <i>Joe</i> returned, he said their Companion
had been young Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,
who wanted, he supposed, to be at the
Beast-Market betimes, or, sure, he would
not have been afoot so early. <i>Joe</i> added
that the Snow was tremendous,&mdash;up to a
Man's Knees in many Parts, and up to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Shoulders under the Banks. We thought
he must be exaggerating; but, however,
the poor Boy had certainly been Half his
Depth in Snow himself, though he averred
he had not stumbled. He said it was freezing
now, and the Roads so slippery that the
Horses stumbled so at every Step that they
were obliged to be led&mdash;he did not believe
they would make more than two Miles an
Hour, and wondered when <i>Gatty</i> would
reach <i>London</i>. <i>Lucy</i> said, "Hush," and
bade him not frighten their <i>Mother</i>, who
was just coming in; but Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>
had heard it all from the Cook-Maid, and
looked very grave. It turned out, that
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> had made <i>Gatty</i> go inside,
and had accompanied her the first Stage.
<i>Joe's</i> Eyes looked very round, and he said,
"Oh, I wasn't to tell that; but Women
will be blabbing." "Who told you not
to tell, <i>Joey</i>?" says <i>Lucy</i>. "If I told
you that, Miss <i>Lucy</i>," says he, "I should
blab too." So then we sat down to
Breakfast, for they were glad of the Excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to repair their hurried Meal by keeping
me Company. After that, we sat
to our Needles, and <i>Joey</i> did Sums or pretended
to do them, and drew Pictures on
his Slate. Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> was a ruminative
Woman of few Words, the younger
Girls were rather afraid of her, and rather
shy towards me, and we missed <i>Gatty</i>
sadly. As for getting out of Doors, we
were close Prisoners, and likely to be for
some Days; the Weather was as bad as
could be, and threatened to be worse.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span></h2>

<h3><i>A Journey in the Snow.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I think</span> a dismaller Thing can scarce be
cited, than a lone dismal House on a
dismal lone Moor, in dismal inclement
Weather, without anything passing or like
to pass on Horse or Foot, without even
a Cart-Track or a Row of black Footprints
to the Gate across the Snow. In-Doors,
small Rooms, somewhat barely
furnished, either bitterly cold, or hot and
close to that Degree as almost to stifle one.
Nobody coming in nor going out; not so
much as a Tradesman's Knock with his
Knuckles at the Back-door; no Newspapers,
no News, no lively Voices, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Letters to be got from the Post, nor any
Possibility of getting a Letter to the Post.
Nothing but to depend on one's own Resources
within the House; happy for the
Housekeeper if no Bread, nor Meat, nor
Tea, nor Salt, nor Sugar, nor Candles,
nor Coals, nor Stores of any Sort be
a-wanting!</p>

<p>I confess a Day or two of that Life
made me heartily sick of it; and yet it
continued for nearly a Week. I thought
what a Goose I was to leave Home to
come to People I knew so little of, and
who knew so little of me. I resolved
within myself it should be long indeed ere
I set out again, "voggetting about," as
the <i>Wiltshire</i> People call it. Change of
Scene, indeed! with Nothing to look out
at but that lonely Snow-covered Moor!
Nobody to speak to but a silent Woman,
with a couple of unfledged Daughters, as
mute as Mice, poring over their Bobbin-Work,
and a Schoolboy that was bidden to
hold his Peace! Nothing to do but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sew, sew, sew, all Day, and think my own
melancholy Thoughts, and wish for a Letter
from Home, and wonder when I should
be able to get back! No Exercise but to
go up to my own Room under Pretence
of washing my Hands, and there gaze out
vacantly on the Snow, or dip into a musty
old Book or two! Why, there was a
hundred Times more Variety and Amusement
in our Shop, any Day, in the worst
of Weathers!</p>

<p>As for Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, she was not
near so dull, though a good deal more
worried; because, though she brewed and
baked at Home, and kept her Store Closet
pretty well supplied, there were certain
little Things that fell short during our
Siege and Beleaguerment, which she had
no Means of supplying. Thus, Butter
ran short; and we all know there's no
Substitute for that! The Salt-box happened
to be nearly empty, and Eggs were
scarce. Luckily, there was no Lack of
Bread, because Flour was plenty, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
always knew how to keep herself supplied
with Yeast, by putting away the wooden
Spoon, unwashed, with which she had
stirred the Yeast at her last Baking. But
Butcher's Meat was scarce, which was
more felt because we could not have Eggs
to our Bacon: however, with one Thing
and another we got on pretty well. She
called me the most contented of Guests;
I told her, truly, I was sorry she should
treat me as a Stranger, and was quite willing
to fare with the Rest.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Tabling troubled me least.
And when I considered how kind they all
were to me, a Stranger, and how great
must be the Sufferings of the Poor and
Needy in such a Season, I felt I was quite
wicked to be secretly complaining merely
because of the Infestivity. I played at
Tit-tat-to with <i>Joe</i>, and posed him with
hard Riddles, and he in return put it to
me&mdash;"If a Herring and a Half cost
three Halfpence, how far is it to <i>Tyburn</i>
Turnpike?" which I told him had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
puzzled me before he was born; and then
I puzzled him by asking, if a Herring and
a Half cost three Halfpence, how many
could he buy for Sixpence; which took
him a good While to make out. The
Girls, seeing me condescend to their
younger Brother, began to think me less
formidable, and to make some bashful
Efforts at my Entertainment; and I then
offered to tell their Fortunes, and showed
them some simple Hocus-pocussing, which
presently set us all laughing; and I found
that the surest Way of being entertained
is to entertain. Besides, we got a little
Exercise by this; for some of the Conjurations
led to hiding, and seeking, and
turning quickly round, and playing Forfeits.
So that we got on pretty well after
a Time; only, all the While I was thinking
when will the Frost break up, and,
shall I be able to get Home?</p>

<p>All this While, we were in Suspense
about <i>Gatty's</i> Safety, and unable to get any
Letter from her; nor did Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
by a single Word or Hint, enable me to
guess whether <i>Gatty</i> had told her of Anything
particular that Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> had
said to her or not. My only Reason for
thinking she had, was her <i>Mother's</i> sometimes
falling into a Reverie as she sate by
the Fire, with a quiet Smile on her Face,
as though she were a thinking of Somewhat
mighty pleasant; and again, by her
frequently praising <i>Gatty</i> to us all, for her
Frankness and steady Pursuit of Duty.</p>

<p>At length, the Snow began to yield a
little; and just as Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> was
beginning to consider whether she might
not send <i>Nanny</i> into the Town for Letters
and other Things much wanted, a Farm-Labourer
from <i>Roaring House</i> came trudging
through the Snow, and said he had
found a Letter lying at the Post-Office for
Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, and had thought she might
be glad to have it. The Man got a Cup
of warm Beer for his Pains; and Mrs.
<i>Bowerbank</i>, seeing the Direction in <i>Gatty's</i>
Hand, came into the Parlour to read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Letter by the Fire, and communicate the
best Part of it to us.</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> said she was much surprised and
very thankful to find that Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
was going to see her safe to the End of
the first Stage. He had insisted on her
going inside, and said he would settle about
that with Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> afterwards; and
the Weather was so dreadful that she had
felt herself justified in being persuaded.
They were the only inside Passengers, and,
with all the Windows up, were not so very
cold; but the Windows were so covered
with Ice that it was impossible to see
through them when Day broke. They
knew the Horses were being led, and that
they were going very slowly, but did not
much mind it, and judged they must have
travelled several Miles, when all at once
they found the Coach give a great Lurch,
and roll over on its Side. They were
quite unable to help themselves, and very
uncomfortable, and rather frightened:
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> did not like breaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Window, for fear of the Shivers falling on
<i>Gatty</i>, and of the Cold to which they should
subsequently be exposed. At length, with
very great Difficulty, he contrived to open
one of the Windows; and the Guard
helped him to scramble out, and lift out
<i>Gatty</i>. To their great Surprise and Mortification
they saw just opposite to them a
Finger-post, with "<i>Three Miles to Larkfield</i>,"
on it. In Fact, they had only just
reached the Heath, where the Road being
marked by no Boundaries, was hidden under
the Snow, and they had strayed off it and
got into a pretty deep Ditch, wherein the
Coach was so fast set as to be immoveable.
There was a Turnpike about a hundred
Yards off, and the Turnpike Man came
running out to see if he could give any
Assistance; so then all the Men, Passengers
and all, set their Shoulders to the Coach
to heave it up; but in forcing it up, one
of the Fore-Wheels came off. Then the
three Horses, which had already broken
their Traces, were sent back to <i>Larkfield</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
with the Postilion, Guard, and Ostler that
had been leading, and the Passengers had
no Help for it but to wait till Post-Chaises
were sent. The Turnpike-Man
invited them into his Cottage, which
they were very thankful to take Shelter
in; there was only one outside Passenger,
whose Face was purple, almost black,
with Cold; and he staggered so that
<i>Gatty</i> at first thought he had been
drinking, but it was because he was benumbed
and dizzy. The Turnpike-Man's
Wife received them very kindly: she was
ironing, and the Room was very small and
steamy, but she made them welcome to
stand round her Fire, and said she had put
off her Washing as long as she possibly
could, because there was only Snow-water
for use, now the Pond was frozen. There
was a Baby crying in its Cradle all the
Time, which its <i>Mother</i> said was because
of the Cold; but <i>Gatty</i> thought it might
be because the <i>Mother</i> had not Time to
attend to it; so she took it up, and cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
it at the Fire, and rubbed its little blue
Hands and Feet till she quieted it. Meanwhile,
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> produced some famous
hot Gingerbread Nuts, which Mrs. <i>Clary</i>
had given him, and the outside Passenger
pulled out a Case-bottle of Brandy, and
the good Woman gave them hot Water,
and supplied Tumblers and Cups, and they
had a very seasonable Luncheon. The
Turnpike-Man said he had not taken
Tolls to the Amount of Tenpence during
the last two Days. His Wife, touched
by <i>Gatty's</i> fondling the Baby, said with
a kind of Remorse, that she wished she
could be sure all was well with a young
Woman carrying an Infant, who had,
with Tears in her Eyes, begged, the Day
before, to chafe its poor little Limbs at
the Fire for a few Minutes before she
crossed the Moor. "There was Something
wild and unsettled in her Look,"
said the good Woman, "that I did not
like, and I asked her, 'Why cross the
Moor at all?' she said, she must, for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
only Chance of Shelter; I asked whence
she came, but she would not say. So
the only Thing was to make her as comfortable
as I could while she remained&mdash;there
was some good strong Pease Soup
on the Fire, and I gave her a Basin of it,
with a Slice of Bread. I never saw a
poor Soul so grateful; she said it warmed
her to the Heart. I also made her take
off her wet Stockings, which were fine
but very old, and put on an old Pair of
thick Woollen ones I had given up
wearing; and I buttoned a Pair of old
Gaiters over all. So then she suckled
the Babe and went her Ways, praying
<span class="smcap">God</span> to bless me; and I watched her
straggling across the Moor, and now and
then plunging into a Snow-Drift. My
Heart ached for her, it did!&mdash;and I
couldn't help thinking, in the Night,
that when the Thaw came, we might
find her poor Corpse under the Snow."</p>

<p>It was Noon, <i>Gatty</i> said, when one
Post-Chaise made its Appearance; so into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
this she and Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> and the other
Passenger were packed, and her Box tied
on behind; and they recommenced their
Journey, Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> sitting between
the two. Their Pace was mended, and
they were congratulating themselves on
their Speed, when, by Reason of the
roundness of the Road, over went the
Chaise. However, they soon righted
again, the Chaise being so much lighter
than the Coach; and they did not overturn
again till just as they got to <i>Newton
Buzzard</i>; which was the first Stage, of
fourteen Miles, from <i>Larkfield</i>. However,
the Day was now so far spent, it
being about three o'Clock, at which
Hour even the Stage-Coach always pulls
up for the Night during Winter, that Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i> said it would be Madness to proceed,
especially as the following Stage
included <i>Splitskull Hill</i>. He had an Aunt
in the Town, at whose House he always
slept when he attended the Markets; so
he went to her while <i>Gatty</i> remained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Inn, to fish for an Invitation. And
the Invitation was not long forthcoming,
so he came back almost directly, and told
<i>Gatty</i> his Aunt would take no Denial; so
they went there and had a very hospitable
Reception from the old Lady, who gave
them a hot Supper and well-aired Beds.
The next Day, the Coach being reported
still immoveable and very ruinous, they
went on as before in a Chaise, and, the
Roads being more beaten, got on much
faster and without any more Impediment,
till they safely reached <i>London</i>, where kind
Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> took leave of <i>Gatty</i> at Lady
<i>Betty's</i> Door.</p>

<p>But, now,&mdash;oh! what News. <i>Gatty</i> on
entering the House, and being fairly shut
into it, learned to her Dismay that Lady
<i>Betty</i> had not summoned her up in one
of her Capricchios, but was laid up with
the Small-Pox, which had caused Madam
<i>Pompon</i> and several other Servants to desert
her, and had occasioned her sending so
peremptorily and laconically for <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, when she got to this,
laid down the Letter and began to cry.
She said she knew <i>Gatty</i> would take the
Infection and die, or else be marked for
life; what a cruel Thing it was of Lady
<i>Betty</i> to send for her, especially as her
<i>Ladyship</i> had been so afraid of catching
the Fever from <i>Gatty</i>. I thought so too,
and quite felt for the poor <i>Mother</i>. She
said that she would go and take <i>Gatty</i>
away directly, without minding what
Lady <i>Betty</i> might think, were it not now
too late to save her from Danger; besides,
how could she bring her Home to her
other Children, who had never had the
Disease?</p>

<p>Then she went on to finish the Letter,
crying over it all the While; and <i>Gatty</i>
proceeded to say, that finding what was
required of her, she recommended herself
to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and, having laid aside her travelling
Dress and taken some slight Refreshment,
she went straight up to my <i>Lady's</i>
Chamber, where she found Lady <i>Betty</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Bed, in very high Fever, attended only by
one of the inferior Servants, quite a low
Person, who had had the Disorder, therefore
had Nothing to fear. That Lady
<i>Betty</i>, being blinded, did not at first recognise
her; but, catching the Sound of
her Voice, cried peremptorily, "Is that
<i>Gatty</i>, at last? Then send <i>Jenny</i> away.
You are not to leave the Room again,
<i>Gatty</i>, but make them bring Everything
to you." Since which, <i>Gatty</i> had remained
at her Bed-side, where she was now
writing, while my <i>Lady</i> lay in a kind of
Stupor, brought on perhaps by her quieting
Medicine; since the Irritation was so great,
she could not keep her Hands off herself,
much less sleep. Indeed, once she had
bidden <i>Gatty</i> tie her Hands up, that she
might not disfigure herself in her Torment;
yet she had soon been unable to keep from
fighting at herself again, and when <i>Gatty</i>
had gently tried to stay her, had fiercely
cried, "Isn't my Face my own, to do with
as I like?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh poor Lady <i>Betty</i>! She that was so
vain of her Beauty! and carried her Head
so high! to be laid thus low, and mastered
by inexorable Disease! deserted by her
pampered Menials that had flattered her
in Health, and beholden for the commonest
Attentions, first to a poor Scullion, and
now to one whom she had inhumanely
neglected in her own Extremity! Was it
not a Lesson to poor, purse-proud, puffed-up
Humanity? And was not <i>Gatty</i> like
an Angel, returning Good for Evil? I lay
awake thinking of it at Night, for many
an Hour.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV.</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Recal.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> same Evening, at Dusk, as we sat
round the Fire, roasting Chestnuts and
Raisins, in comes young Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,
buttoned to the Chin; and his Eyes and
Cheeks in such a Glow with Exercise that
I could not help thinking to myself,
"What a nice-looking young Man you
are!" He shook Hands very heartily
all round, first with Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, next
with me; and, addressing me first, "Mrs.
<i>Patty</i>," says he, "I come to repair and
excuse the Negligence of my stupid
Fellow, who forgot he had taken up at
the Post-office two Letters for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
House, and brought one addressed to you
on to <i>Roaring House</i>."</p>

<p>I eagerly received it; and seeing <i>Prue's</i>
Hand, hastily broke the Seal. At the
same Instant, Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, in a lamentable
Voice, says, "Oh, Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>!
only think of our <i>Gatty</i> taking the
Small-Pox!"</p>

<p>He turned so deadly white, that I saw
in a Moment how it was with him, and
hastily cried, "Lady <i>Betty</i>, you mean,
Ma'am, not <i>Gatty</i>!"</p>

<p>"But <i>Gatty</i> has no doubt taken it by
this Time," says her <i>Mother</i>, "since she
is constantly with Lady <i>Betty</i>."</p>

<p>Seeing Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> look much agitated,
and supposing he might like to be
alone with Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>, I rose and
left the Room, to read my Letter up-Stairs,
thinking she might send the Girls
away if she wished. On running through
<i>Prudence's</i> Letter, I was quite disappointed
to find it contain so little, whether of
News or Affection. Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<i>Tom</i>, she never so much as named; my
<i>Mother</i>, she said, was pretty well, my <i>Father</i>
the same as usual; there were sundry
little Details about our Business, but not a
Word I cared to hear; ending with the
same comfortless Burthen, "We can get
on perfectly well without you." I was so
tired of the Country, that I had hoped
there would have been some Wish expressed
for my Company, which would
have been a decent Pretext for my Return;
but no! Nothing of the Sort! I remained
musing over my Letter with great Mortification
till I got quite numbed with Cold,
and was roused by hearing the Gate shut.
I saw Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> going away; and when
I went down, Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i> was not in
the Room, and the Girls and their Brother
were still roasting their Chestnuts.</p>

<p>The next Day was much like the preceding,
except that a rapid Thaw set in.
On the Day following that, a Post was
due, and <i>Joe</i> was sent through Mud and
Mire to see if there were any Letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<i>Gatty</i>. There was not; but there was
one for me; that made me think I would
never wantonly desire a Pretext for a Recal
again. It was from <i>Prudence</i>; but oh, in
how different a Spirit from the other! She
wrote in the utmost Hurry and Distress to
tell me that my <i>Father</i> had fallen down
Stairs and broken his Leg, and had likewise
injured his Head so much, that Dr.
<i>Elwes</i> thought there was a Concussion of
the Brain. My dear <i>Mother</i> and <i>Prue</i>
were incessantly in Attendance on him,
and considered him in great Danger; they
hoped I would return as soon as I possibly
could.</p>

<p>With my Eyes full of Tears, I went to
communicate my bad News to Mrs. <i>Bowerbank</i>,
who was vastly distressed for me, and
would say Nothing to delay my Journey,
especially now that the Thaw rendered
the Roads much safer. So I packed up at
once, and, the next Morning, left them all
with many Thanks for their Kindness.
<i>Joe</i>, who had become quite my little Cavalier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
accompanied me to the Corner, where
we met the Coach, carrying for me a
Basket of the large Cat's-head Apples
that some call "Go-no-farther." I was
the only Passenger, and was two Days on
the Road instead of one; but performed
the Journey in perfect Safety.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when I reached Home.
<i>Prudence</i>, hearing my Voice, flew down
Stairs and threw her Arms round my
Neck all in Tears. I wept too, and never
was there a more sisterly Meeting. She
told me my dear <i>Father</i> was still very
bad; and though my <i>Mother</i> kept up
wonderfully, she was exerting herself so
much for him that she would probably
experience a dangerous Re-action. "But
what can I do?" says <i>Prue</i> weeping,
"I've hovered about him continually and
done my very best; but whenever he's
himself, he doesn't like my Nursing,
and says, 'There, let me have your
<i>Mother</i> till <i>Patty</i> comes back!'" And
she cried bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>I said, "Dear <i>Prue</i>, People when they
are ill will take unaccountable Fancies;
and we have a divided Duty, between
the Sick-Room and the Shop. Let us
each take that which suits us best; do
you attend to the Business, which you
understand so well, and I will help my
<i>Mother</i> to nurse my <i>Father</i>."</p>

<p>She said, still crying, "I suppose that
will be best; but I love him as well as
you do, and you must let me take my
Turn now and then, or my Heart will
break."</p>

<p>I said, "I will, I will;" and all this
While I was taking off my Wraps, and
making ready to go up Stairs; but <i>Prudence</i>
would make me take a Dish of Tea
first, which was ready poured out, saying,
that when I was once up-Stairs I should
be close Prisoner, and my <i>Father</i> could
not bear so much as the Click of a Spoon.
She added, "Dr. <i>Elwes</i> is not afraid of
the Brain now; but my <i>Father</i> is of
such an inflammatory Habit that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Fever runs very high, and he is not
always himself."</p>

<p>"And Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>?" said I. "Is not
he truly concerned about it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>?" cries she, "Why,
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> is not here now!"</p>

<p>"Not here now?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh no, he returned to his Parish the
Day before <i>Father's</i> Accident, thinking
himself well enough to do Duty now,
and we have not heard of him since."</p>

<p>I was struck dumb. I looked full at
<i>Prudence</i>, who spoke and carried herself
quite composedly. Seeing me look so
hard at her, however, she blushed all over;
Cheek, Neck, and Brow, one hot Flush;
and started up to busy herself about some
Trifle.</p>

<p>I felt a Pang, but it was for her, not
myself. Poor <i>Prue</i> found herself deserted!
All my old Love for her resumed its
Strength; but there was no Time now for
Pity or Complaint&mdash;I rose up, saying,
"Well, I will go up-Stairs now; keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
yourself up, dear <i>Prue</i>; there's no knowing
how much your Strength may be
wanted."</p>

<p>"There is not, indeed," said she, bursting
into Tears afresh. I could not stand
this&mdash;I said, "Come, <i>Prue</i>, come, ..."
and put my Arm about her, and she laid
her Head on my Shoulder. I was obliged
to gulp down my own Tears, but I said
gently, "This will never do&mdash;we must
not give way&mdash;Only think how much
more poor <i>Father</i>, and dear <i>Mother</i> too,
have to bear than we have. You must
give over Crying, for indeed I cannot go
up till you do."</p>

<p>"You may go now," says she, wiping
her Eyes and smiling up at me, "for,
strange as it may seem to you, I'm the
better for this Cry. Go up now, go
softly; and send dear <i>Mother</i> down to
me presently, if you can, for she needs
Rest and Refreshment."</p>

<p>I said, "I will," and went up. My
<i>Father</i> was dozing when I entered&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<i>Mother</i> sitting beside him, with her Hands
clasped on her Knee. As soon as she saw
me, she mutely held out her Arms without
rising; and the next Instant I was folded
to her Heart. We spoke a little in
Whispers; and for a While I thought
not nor desired to persuade her to go. At
length I did; and she, after a little Resistance,
yielded; for she was very much
exhausted. I quietly took her Place, and
remained in it a long While, inactive in
Body, but with a Mind how busy!</p>

<p>Home, at last! and to a Scene how
changed! Everything as still and quiet as
on <i>Larkfield</i> Moor! He that had been
the Life of many a noisy, convivial Party,
laid low&mdash;perhaps rapidly drawing nigh
an unknown World. My <i>Mother</i>, roused
from her incapable State by strong Affection;
<i>Prue</i>, loving me again, and in Tears&mdash;Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i> gone!</p>

<p>What a Dream this World seems sometimes!
Besides, my Head was mazed
with my Journey, and I was stiff with so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
much Jolting, and the Closeness and
Warmth of the Chamber after the biting
Cold of the outer Air made me feel
drowsy. But I would not yield to it.</p>

<p>A Coffin flew out of the Fire. I was
thankful not to be superstitious. But yet
I'd as lief it had been a Purse.</p>

<p>I thought of <i>Gatty's</i> lone Watch; and
how much harder her Post was than mine.
I was not incurring personal Danger in
the Service of an imperious, unfeeling
Patient; I was not separated from a
Mother and Sister whom I loved; I was
watching over some one very dear to me.
Thinking of her and of my <i>Father</i> and
<i>Mother</i>, I framed my Thoughts to Prayer.
Suddenly my <i>Father</i>, without opening his
Eyes, murmured, "<i>Delia!</i> Give me your
Hand!... Poor <i>Delia</i>, I have been very
untoward to thee&mdash;"</p>

<p>Silently, I placed my Hand in his.
<i>Cordelia</i> was my <i>Mother's</i> Name, but he
was accustomed to call her <i>Delia</i> for short;
or rather, <i>had</i> been accustomed, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
old Days of Love and Harmony. I took
it for a good Sign, his calling her so again;
it showed that his Illness and her Tenderness
had melted him. I always liked his
Abbreviation of her Name, myself, though
<i>Prue</i> thought it only fit for a China
Shepherdess.</p>

<p>"Who have I got hold of?" says he.
"This isn't <i>Delia's</i> Hand!&mdash;Ah, I see the
Shadow of <i>Patty's</i> Nose against the Bed-curtain.
Welcome, Child! come, kiss
thy poor old <i>Dad</i>."</p>

<p>Daddy, again, was a Word he never
used but lovingly. I stooped over him,
and kissed him two or three Times; then
set him completely to rights, for his Head
had slipped off the Pillow, and he was
lying very uncomfortably, without the
Power to right himself.</p>

<p>"You're a prime one!" says he. "Thy
dear <i>Mother</i> has no Strength to handle
me, though the Will's ne'er a-wanting;
and I can't bear her to move me for fear
of her doing herself a Hurt. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<i>Prue</i>, she does nought but sit by the
Fire and sigh! But thou'rt able and
willing both, <i>Patty</i>; so keep about me
all you can."</p>

<p>I promised him I would, and he soon
became again quiet. <i>Prudence</i> presently
stole in; and in dumb Show bade me go
down to sup with my <i>Mother</i>. As my
<i>Father</i> seemed sleeping, I did so, and had
a long Talk with dear <i>Mother</i>; after
which, I prevailed with her to sleep with
<i>Prue</i>, and let me keep Watch, assuring
her I was quite fresh. She consented at
length, from sheer Incapacity to hold out
any longer; and, after a good Meal, I
went up and took my Sister's Place.
Shortly, the House became perfectly silent,
and the distant Clocks struck Twelve.</p>

<p>I sate by the Fire, musing on many
Things and Persons, and a good deal of
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>; and, before I was aware,
large Tears were quietly rolling down my
Face. I was not pleased with my late
Conduct of my own Mind, and resolved on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
more Self-control and Self-discipline.
While framing these seasonable Resolutions,
a Strain of low, sweet, solemn
Music stole through the Air. The Christmas
Waits were playing beneath some
distant Window, and at the End of their
soft Melody, I could make out by the
Rhythm, though not by the Articulation,
the poor Musicians crying out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The Chelsea Waits make bold to call,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Good-morrow to you; Masters and Mistresses all.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I dreaded their waking my <i>Father</i> as
they drew nearer, but there was no Help
for it. I rested my Head against the high
Back of the Nursing-chair, in a Kind of
dreamy, lazy Luxury, listening to the
lovely Sounds; and called to Mind the old
Text, "Ye shall have a Song in the Night;
as when some holy Solemnity is kept."</p>

<p>Ah, thought I, we are apt to fancy ourselves
in the Blackness of Darkness, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
any Sorrow or Bereavement comes over us,
and yet our good <span class="smcap">God</span> sends us a Song in
the Night!&mdash;The poor Shepherds in the
Fields of <i>Bethlehem</i> lay watching their
Flocks by Night, when all seemed dark
and dreary, but suddenly a Light shone
upon them, and they heard sweet Music in
the Air, even sweeter than that which I
hear now.</p>

<p>Then I thought of the Manger, and the
holy Child, and the Mother; and the wise
Men following the Star. The Folds of
the Window-curtains were a little apart,
and I could see the Stars glimmering.</p>

<p>All at once, my <i>Father</i>, in a hurried
Voice, exclaims, "They're moving
now!"</p>

<p>"What, dear <i>Father</i>?" said I softly,
looking in on him.</p>

<p>"Cover them up! cover them up!"
cries he rapidly; "tie their Legs, or they'll
set my Head spinning&mdash;Hey, diddle
diddle! the Cat plays the Fiddle; and
the Shepherdess is <i>gavotting</i> with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Turnspit! Lock 'em up, I say! Dash
them in Pieces! Break them!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear <i>Father</i>, hush&mdash;" said I
gently; but he was quite unconscious of
my Presence, or of anything about him,
and grew more and more light-headed.
Had I not previously nursed <i>Gatty</i> in her
Deliration, I should have been even more
terrified than I was: at all Events, it was
awful Work; it was more fearful to hear
a strong Man raving than the lunatic
Ramblings of a gentle Girl. But what
Help was there for it? I must e'en do the
best I could. He tossed his Arms about
wildly; and once or twice made as though
he would start up; but the Splint on his
Leg prevented that. Then he groaned
heavily, gnashed his Teeth, called for
Drink, rolled his Eyes, shuddered, and
finally subsided into fitful Mutterings.
Gradually these yielded to Stupor; I looked
in on him from Time to Time, hoping
to find him asleep, but there were his half-open,
unwinking Eyes, glaring at me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
without any Token of Recognition. I do
not know that my Strength was ever more
sorely tried.</p>

<p>Towards Day-dawn he slumbered. I
am ashamed to say, I dropped asleep too;
it was not for long, I believe, yet when
I woke up, the Fire was nearly out; and
<i>Prue</i>, in her Dressing-Jacket, was on her
Knees before it, stealthily reviving it. She
put her Finger on her Lips, then came to
me and kissed me. The snapping of a
very small Stick woke my restless <i>Father</i>,
who, no longer in his Fever-fit, and excessive
low and sinking, cries in a feeble Voice,
"Who's there? <i>Prue</i>, I know, by her
Sighing! Go, get me some spiced Wine
and Toast, for I'm ebbing away as fast as
I can."</p>

<p>"He always talks like that, when he
comes to," whispers <i>Prue</i>, seeing me
look frightened. "We dare not give him
Wine, but Tea and Toast he shall have.
I will bring it him directly; and then
you shall go down and have some too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
while I stay with him, for you look
completely worn out."</p>

<p>In fact, I felt so just then; and though
quite ashamed to be knocked up with one
Night's Nursing, yet my two Days'
Journey began to tell upon me; and I
felt, that to husband my Strength for what
probably lay before me, I must take common
Precautions. Therefore, when <i>Prue</i>
brought up my <i>Father's</i> Breakfast, I went
down to mine.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XV.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Mr. Honeywood's Fancies.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> the Sun had not yet risen, I
found a bright little Fire already kindled
in the Parlour, and the little oval Table
drawn close to it, and spread for Breakfast,
with strong Tea and hot Toast awaiting
me on the Hob. I felt very grateful to
<i>Prudence</i> for this Kindness; and had scarce
seated myself when I heard the soft Tap
of my <i>Mother's</i> Ivory-headed Walking-cane
as she came down Stairs. I hastened
to receive her; she kissed my Forehead,
and then looked at me with anxious Affection.</p>

<p>"You are weary, my dear Love," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
she, "and no wonder. What kind of a
Night?"</p>

<p>"He was feverish, dear <i>Mother</i>."</p>

<p>"And wandering, doubtless&mdash;I see it
was so. Were you frightened?"</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;you know I had nursed
<i>Gatty</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor <i>Gatty</i>!&mdash;a very different
Patient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>Mother</i>; but his Ramblings gave
me no Distress, except as they betokened
the height of his Fever&mdash;He fancied
himself playing Cards:&mdash;and seemed to
think People were dancing. He spoke
very kindly of you."</p>

<p>My <i>Mother</i> wiped her Eyes. "That
has been the solitary Alleviation all
along," said she. "His old Liking for
me has returned."</p>

<p>After we had breakfasted, she accompanied
me to his Chamber: "Ah, you're
come at last," said my <i>Father</i>, feebly
extending his Hand to her, "I was
wearying of <i>Prue's</i> Sighs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear <i>Father</i>, I haven't been sighing,"
said <i>Prudence</i>, hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't you though, Mrs. <i>Prue</i>?"&mdash;She
put her Hand before her Eyes, and
silently quitted the Room.</p>

<p>"My Love, how are you?" says my
<i>Mother</i> to him.</p>

<p>"I've had fine Company all Night, Mrs.
<i>Honeywood</i>. I've been to the queerest
Ball!&mdash;Ah, you think I'm wandering,
but I'm not&mdash;my Head is as clear as
yours. At twelve o'Clock at Night, a
Flourish of Tin Trumpets announced the
Commencement of the Entertainment."</p>

<p>My <i>Mother</i> looked at me in Distress.</p>

<p>"An old Joss in the Corner," continues
he, "played the Hautboy. A Mandarin
kept Time, nodding his Head. Then,
down came the Five Senses&mdash;you think
I've lost mine, but I haven't!&mdash;followed
by the Shepherds and Shepherdesses, all
in <i>Chelsea</i> China, and took their respective
Places. A Row of <i>Dresden</i>
Cups were the Bystanders, backed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
some richly painted Plates against the
Wall. Bang! went the Drum. The
Ball immediately opened, and I knew
not which Dancer most to admire. Such
sinking! such rising! such easy Turns
and Inflections; such pointing of Toes
and presenting of Hands! Meantime,
the Music plays faster and faster; the
Joss blows himself out of Breath, the
Mandarin niddle-noddles, till it makes
one's Head spin to look at him. Down
falls a Dragon and gets cracked; the
others fall and sprawl over him; never
mind, he's up again, and they're at it
harder than ever. Hands across, down
the Middle, turn the Corners and
pousette! My Head is too weak to bear
it; a small Cream-Ewer invites me into
the Card-room. Gratefully I accept it,
when one of the Senses assails me, insisting
I shall dance the Minuet <i>de la
Cour</i>. I put her aside, she returns, I
burst from her, she pursues; I hurry
into the Card-room, where four respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<i>Chinese</i> are playing at Loo. They
make Room for me, I sit down, we get
on very comfortably together; when lo
you! in burst the Five Senses again,
calling me a Recreant, and I know not
what all, plucking at me, nipping,
pinching, grinning in my Face; the
Music playing furiously all the While&mdash;They
cry out the Prices at which I
bought them; one of them names the
wrong Sum. I exclaim, 'That's false!'
and give her a Cuff that breaks her all to
smash. 'Going, going, going, gone!' cries
the Auctioneer in the Corner. Down goes
his Hammer: the Ball is ended. Why,
Mrs. <i>Honeywood</i>, Ma'am, you're crying!"</p>

<p>Just then, Dr. <i>Elwes</i> very opportunely
came in, with his grave, kind Face. The
Sound of his Voice seemed to re-collect
my Father's scattered Faculties; he did
not appear half so bad as he had done
before; nevertheless, I could see the good
Physician thought unfavourably of him.
In short, for several Days he hung between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Life and Death; after that, he wandered
no more, and slowly amended; requiring
incessant and vigilant Nursing.</p>

<p>It was one Day, when <i>Prue</i> and my
Mother had insisted on my going down
Stairs for a little Change, that, on entering
the Parlour, I suddenly came on Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i>. "Ah!"&mdash;said he, and held out
his Hand. Overcome by the Surprise, I
turned aside my Head, and burst into Tears.
The next Moment, his Arm was round my
Waist; and as quickly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Patty</i>!" said he.</p>

<p>I drew back, and would have left the
Room, but he gently detained me, and led
me to a Chair next the Fire.</p>

<p>"I was quite unprepared to hear of this
domestic Calamity," said he, "and have
been greatly moved by it. Your good
Mother has been telling me how admirably
you have behaved. She wept about
it, and said never was such a Daughter."</p>

<p>This set my Tears flowing again&mdash;I said
there was Nothing out of the Common in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a Daughter's tending of a Parent she loved.
He did not dwell on it; but went on to
talk as only a good, feeling, and faithful
Minister, a holy, high-minded, heavenly
spirited Servant of God can talk. I know
not how long this delightful Conversation
lasted; perhaps an Hour; and when he
went away, he said he would soon come
again. From that Moment, I was a new
Creature: quite fresh, quite able to return
anew to my Post. My Heart was full of
Peace. If the Body sometimes bears down
the Mind, the Mind sometimes wondrously
sustains the Body.</p>

<p>This was, however, a joyless Christmas
to us all. Not one of the Family was
able to leave the House to go to Church;
and though roast Beef and Plum-pudding
were dressed, they were sparingly and sadly
partaken of. My loved Mother forgot
not, however, to send Portions to sundry
poor Widows and Mothers who were
habituated to come to us for our stale
Pastry, Broken-meat, and Cinders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>When my <i>Father</i> began to recover a
little, he became curious to hear me talk
about my Visit to <i>Larkfield</i>; and he made
me minutely describe <i>Gatty's</i> Family, and
the Family at <i>Roaring House</i>. In a very
little While he settled it to his own Satisfaction
that <i>Gatty</i> would some Day be
Mrs. <i>Heavitree</i>. But when he heard of
her being recalled to Servitude by Lady
<i>Betty</i>, of her perilous, protracted Journey,
and of her finding my Lady in the Small-Pox,
he became greatly perturbed.
"What," says he, "have not one of you
had so much Humanity nor even so
much Curiosity, (a Quality, one would
think, not often lacking in your Sex,) as
to ascertain whether this poor Girl sink
or swim?"</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Father</i>, we have been so busied
about you...."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks' Ends! I have never had
more than one of you about me at a
Time; and has everything else been at
a Stand-still? Have your Shop-shutters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
been put up, have your Customers been
kept out, have you intermitted your
Baking and your Milking? Pshaw! I'm
nauseated with such a false Excuse. If
you couldn't go, you might write; if you
could not write, you might send; if you
could not spare one of the Men, you
might have sent a Boy for Two-pence.
Let me hear by To-morrow Morning, I
insist upon't, whether Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> be
alive or dead."</p>

<p>He was quite in a Turmoil about it,
and for my Part, I was glad enough to be
commissioned to send; and as <i>Peter</i> knew
the House, I contrived he should go that
same Afternoon, and ask for Mr. <i>James</i>,
and inquire how fared Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> and
Lady <i>Betty</i>&mdash;bidding him be sure he put
Lady <i>Betty's</i> Name first, or they would
think we knew no Manners.</p>

<p>So he went, and brought back Word,
with Mr. <i>James'</i> Services, that my <i>Lady</i>
was still very ill, and still kept her Chamber,
and so did Mrs. <i>Gatty</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>I said, "Did he mean Mrs. <i>Gatty</i> was
confined to her own Chamber or to my
<i>Lady's</i>? for that makes all the Difference."</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> says, "Well, Ma'am, I understood
him to mean she kept my <i>Lady's</i> Chamber;
but I gave you the very Words he
said."</p>

<p>So I gave them, just the same, to my <i>Father</i>.</p>

<p>"Blockhead! Dunderhead!" exclaimed
he impatiently. "Well, if she's in her
Chamber, she's not in the Churchyard
at any Rate&mdash;And I shall soon be able
to spare you, <i>Patty</i>, to go and see how
she really is."</p>

<p>That Night <i>Prudence</i> and I slept together,
for the first Time since my Return
Home. Before that, I had lain in the
little Closet close to my <i>Father's</i> Room,
to be within Call. We undressed silently
enough, and I noticed again the great
Depression she had betrayed ever since my
Return; but yet I was as quiet as she.</p>

<p>When the Candle was put out, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
crept closer to me; and though she was
quiet for a While, I had an Impression she
was going to say Something. At length,
"<i>Patty</i>," says she,&mdash;and I could perceive
her Voice was unsteady, "did you ever
know what a Burthen it was to have
Something on your Mind that you longed,
yet feared, to tell?"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I can form some
Notion of the Pain it must give."</p>

<p>"I have that Pain," says she, and fell a
crying.</p>

<p>I said, "Come, <i>Prue</i>, tell me what it
is. We didn't use to have any Secrets
from one another."</p>

<p>"Nor needed to have," says she in her
Tears&mdash;"All that's altered now."</p>

<p>"Why should it be?" said I. She
made no Answer.</p>

<p>"Come, what is it?" I said.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember saying to me,
'How fine we are!' a Day or two back,"
says <i>Prue</i>, "when you noted a Ruby Ring
on my Finger?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"A <i>Mock</i> Ruby, you mean! It's a Glass
Ring, if ever there was one! I told you,
if I wore Jewels at all, they should be
real."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I said Nothing, and I dare
say you thought I was sulky, but I wasn't.
People often make great Mistakes in
judging others. Well, that Ring was
given me by <i>Tom</i>."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't ruin him then," said I
laughing. "Unless indeed, poor Fellow,
as is like enough, 'twas palmed upon
him for a real Stone. Well, <i>Prue</i>, is
this what all the Sighing has been about?
You needn't break your Heart, I think,
at having accepted it of him."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, or you'll kill me," says
<i>Prudence</i>, "it's no laughing Matter, I can
tell you. It don't matter whether the
Stone be real or false; but, in fact, it's a
Wedding ... no, a Guard-Ring."</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>?" cried I. "Do say it over
again!" But she was crying passionately.</p>

<p>"What's this about Wedding and Guard-Rings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<i>Prue</i>? Do you mean to say you
are <i>married</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>Patty</i>! don't speak so unkindly&mdash;I
can't bear it."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be unkind,"&mdash;and I
kissed her. "But you rack me with
Suspense. Do speak out! Are you, <i>can</i>
you be married to <i>Tom</i>?"</p>

<p>"Whether or no, I'm engaged to him
quite as irrevocably, I assure you, <i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>"You amaze and distress me beyond
Measure," said I.</p>

<p>"I knew you would be very angry with
me," said she.</p>

<p>"Angry? why should I be angry?
There's no Reason why <i>Tom</i> and you
should not marry, if you like it, except
his Profession, and his being unable to
keep a Wife. Two serious Exceptions,
I admit."</p>

<p>"So serious, <i>Patty</i>, that I fear my
<i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i> would never overlook
them&mdash;Oh! how angry my <i>Father</i> would
be! I should never hear the Last of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he <i>would</i> be angry, I dare say,
but it would not be the first Time; and
you generally bear his Rebukes pretty
sturdily. If I were in love with <i>Tom</i>,
I think I could stand that."</p>

<p>"Do you indeed, dear <i>Patty</i>? Ah, but
you don't know the Worst."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the Worst, then?" cried I
impatiently&mdash;"Say in a Word." But she
could not speak it.</p>

<p>"I can't make Head nor Tail of it,"
said I&mdash;"It seems such an unaccountable
Business. I thought you cared for Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i>."</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>? Oh, <i>Patty</i>! how
<i>could</i> you be such a Goose?"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Prue</i>, I chanced to see him
one Day holding you by the Hand at
his Window, and talking very earnestly."</p>

<p>"Why, he was talking about <i>Tom</i>, and
advising me not to go to the Play!"</p>

<p>"Was that it? Dear me!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and&mdash;and&mdash;You know, <i>Patty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Tom</i> paid me a good Deal of Attention
from the First; and somehow I was won
by it, there's Something so sincere and
genuine about him. And he's very
diverting too, and the Soul of Good-humour&mdash;in
short, I liked him very
much; all the better for his liking me,
and telling me so whenever we went
out together. Well, when he went
Home with the Monkey, I missed him
sadly; and as you were very short upon
me about that Time, I thought you saw
how it was and didn't like it; which
made me vex a good Deal. When he
came back, I was very glad; and when
you were gone, he kept staying on, till
it was Time to return to his Ship. The
last Walk we took together, which was
when he was on the very Brink of
Sailing, out it all came! he made me
a downright Offer, and said you knew
all about it, he had spoken to you at
the <i>Old Angel</i>, and you were favourable.
Well, this encouraged me, and so I as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
good as said yes, only I told him I knew
<i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i> would be hurt at it,
on such a short Courting, and therefore
could not tell them of it till he returned
from his next Voyage. <i>Tom</i> was quite
willing; for what good would it have
done him? only he begged and prayed
me to keep constant to him, and not be
over-persuaded, while he was away, to
have any one else; which of course I
promised. So we walked along together
as merry as Birds, though on the Point
of parting for two Years, without much
noting Anything going on around us, till
we were forced to pause by a Knot of
People on the Pavement, seeing a fine
Lady get out of a Hackney-Coach. <i>Tom</i>
drew me closer to him; and at the same
Moment a Man in a black Coat pops
his Face under <i>Tom's</i> Hat, and says,
'Will you like to be married, Sir?' <i>Tom</i>
bursts out laughing with Surprise, and
says, 'Aye, that I should, my Lad!' and
the Man taking him by the Shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and giving him a Push, we were under
a little Gothic Doorway the next
Minute. A gay bridal Party coming
out, pressed us against the Wall. 'Dear
<i>Tom</i>,' whispered I fearfully, 'what Place
is this? It's no Church.' 'Not a bit
of it,' replies he, smiling, 'but yet here's
a Parson marrying People, many of them
of Quality too; and though I don't
suppose he can tie a very tight Knot, it
will serve to keep you engaged to me
till I come back; and then we'll have
a merry Wedding, with Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> for
our Parson.' And oh, <i>Patty</i>, he took
me so by Surprise that I was over-persuaded!"</p>

<h3><i>The Imprudence of Prudence.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"I never</span> heard tell of such a Thing in
my Life!" cried I, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew you'd say so," said <i>Prudence</i>,
lapsing into Tears. "It was so
very silly."</p>

<p>"Silly? Wicked! Such a Mockery!
You don't call it a real Marriage, I
hope!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no. But if you were in my
Place, you wouldn't consider yourself at
Liberty to marry another?"</p>

<p>"I can't fancy myself in your Place,
<i>Prudence</i>! I would not have done such
a Thing for the World! Certainly, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
could not consider myself free! Nor <i>him</i>
secure! Fleet Marriages, I know, are
binding in Law; but there's no Religion
in them. Have you got a Certificate?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, a License, and a Certificate,
and a Crown Stamp that cost a Guinea;
and a Ring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That cost Two-pence! All of a Piece
with the Rest. I never knew such a
Jumble in all my Life! Never!"</p>

<p>"It was great Folly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know, <i>Prue</i>, what Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
told us Folly is synonymous with in
Scripture&mdash;<i>Sin</i>. 'The Foolishness of
Fools is Folly'&mdash;He told us that was the
same as 'the Foolishness of Fools is
<i>Sin</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Patty</i>, don't trample upon me,
now I'm down. I've vexed enough
about it, already. That is, I've vexed
about what you, and <i>Mother</i>, and <i>Father</i>,
would think of it; for I must say, I'm
glad to be secure of <i>Tom</i> against he next
comes Home&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might have been secure of him
already; if his Love was worth Anything,
which I can readily believe it to
be. You might have trusted him."</p>

<p>"I might; and he me. It was only
the Folly of a Moment."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>Prue</i>, how often has the Folly of
a Moment been the Ruin of a Life!
This Man was a Clergyman, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, no doubt of that. He was
a Reverend Mr. <i>Sympson</i>, of some College,
<i>Cambridge</i>, and late Chaplain of
the Earl of <i>Rothes</i>. So he said."</p>

<p>"That's well put in."</p>

<p>"Well, he looked quite respectable,
and you know there are many Clergy
within the Rules. Don't be too suspicious,
<i>Patty</i>."</p>

<p>"Why, haven't I good Reason to be,
<i>Prue</i>? Only it's all too late, now&mdash;Oh
dear me!" And I groaned heavily.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all too late now," said <i>Prue</i>
rapidly, "and I meant no Harm, and we
must make the best of it, and I feel a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
great Load off my Mind, now I've told
<i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you've only shifted it from
your own Mind to mine! I don't feel at
all obliged to you!"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps poor <i>Mother</i> might say
the same; so we had better not tell her."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Prue, Prue</i>! how one Sin leads
to another! The Case is quite different.
She has a <i>right</i> to her Child's Confidence."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>you</i> don't tell her Everything,
do you?"</p>

<p>"What have I ever concealed?"</p>

<p>"That you care about Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>."</p>

<p>The Blood rushed to my Face, though
we were in the Dark. "That's quite
another Matter," said I. "You don't
know that I care for him."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>Patty</i>! how <i>can</i> you say so?"</p>

<p>"At all Events, he has never shown me
any decided Preference that would justify
me, as a modest young Woman, in
letting his Name escape my Lips. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
know, <i>Prudence</i>, how different the Cases
are. Certainly, if my dear <i>Mother</i>, who
is all Kindness and Truth, were to think
fit to speak to me on that or any similar
Subject, I might blush, I might shed a
Tear, I might feel very uncomfortable,
but I should answer her with perfect
Sincerity."</p>

<p>"Ah <i>Patty</i>! you are very good&mdash;And
I am very bad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, I won't hear you say that of
yourself. You have certainly been very,
very foolish."</p>

<p>"And 'the Foolishness of Fools is Sin.'"
Here she again wept.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Prue</i>, if it <i>be</i> so, still we know
what is to be done."</p>

<p>"What? Oh, tell me!"</p>

<p>"'I will arise, and go unto my Father,
and will say unto him&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, not to my <i>Father</i>!"</p>

<p>"'To my <i>Mother</i>, and will say unto
her, <i>Mother</i>, I have....'"</p>

<p>My own Tears here burst forth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
believe they, and the few Words of the
Text I had cited proved the best Eloquence;
for in an Instant <i>Prue</i> was clinging to me,
choking in Tears, and saying, "I will! I
will!"</p>

<p>Overcome by our Emotions, we said no
more till we slept, I holding her to my
Heart, full of Love and Pity, though
perturbed beyond Expression at her Conduct.</p>

<p>My <i>Father</i> requiring so much of our
Care, it was seldom that we were all three
together; however, the next Day, after he
had dined with more Comfort to himself
than usual, he folded his Hands together
and said, "Thank <span class="smcap">God</span> for my good
Dinner! And now I'll have a Nap,
and you may all go down Stairs till I
pull the Bell."</p>

<p>Some trifling Affair prevented my immediately
joining my <i>Mother</i> and <i>Sister</i>.
When I went into the Parlour, I found
<i>Prue</i> had just screwed her Courage to the
Point of Confession. "<i>Mother</i>," she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
saying, "I've done so wrong&mdash;" and began
to cry.</p>

<p>"What is it, <i>Prue</i>?" said my <i>Mother</i>
gently, who was blanching Almonds.</p>

<p>"Say first, <i>Mother</i>, that you'll forgive
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, let me first hear what I have to
forgive. I am not such a very unforgiving
Person, Child, am I?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, <i>Mother</i>!" kissing her
Hand. "But oh! I don't know what
you'll say! I'm engaged to <i>Tom</i>!"</p>

<p>"I guessed as much long ago," said my
<i>Mother</i> coolly.</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you were very poor Secret-keepers,
<i>Prue</i>; clumsy Adepts in Concealment!
I guessed, ever since he went,
that that Glass Ring was a Love-token."</p>

<p><i>Prue</i> blushed very deeply. "Ah," said
she, fluttering, and looking with downcast
Fondness on the slighted Bauble, "it <i>is</i> a
Love-token, indeed, <i>Mother</i>! and even
more than that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"What more?" said my <i>Mother</i> quickly.
<i>Prudence</i> was silent.</p>

<p>"You don't mean, <i>Prudence</i>," with
some Agitation in her Tone, "that it's a
Wedding Ring?"</p>

<p>"What if it were, dear <i>Mother</i>?" (faltering)&mdash;"Should
you be very angry?"</p>

<p>"I should be angry and hurt&mdash;deeply
hurt!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" <i>Prue</i>, who was kneeling beside
my <i>Mother</i>, turned her Head aside and
looked into the Fire.</p>

<p>"Speak, <i>Patty</i>!" said my Mother,
much perturbed, "and tell me if you can&mdash;since
your <i>Sister</i> will not&mdash;Has there
been a Marriage?"</p>

<p>"A Fleet-Marriage, or Something of
that Sort," said I, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"A Fleet-Marriage?" cried my <i>Mother</i>,
holding up her Hands, and sinking back in
her Chair.</p>

<p>"<i>Mother! Mother!</i> hear me," cries
<i>Prue</i>, casting her Arms across my <i>Mother's</i>
knees and looking up at her. "We parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
at the Church-door,&mdash;House-door, I
mean; we knew we were only engaged;
we did not look on it as a regular
Marriage,&mdash;only as binding us together
a little&mdash;it was the Thought of a Moment&mdash;<i>Tom</i>
proposed it first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said my <i>Mother</i>, with a
Tone of infinite Scorn; "but I little
thought that a Daughter of mine could
be so persuaded. Oh <i>Prue, Prue</i>! I
never could have believed it of you!
No Wonder you have gone about sighing
and hanging your Head&mdash;it has been
your only Act of Grace."</p>

<p><i>Prue</i>, humiliated beyond Expression at
these Reproaches, was crying silently&mdash;"Don't
tell my <i>Father</i>," at length said
she.</p>

<p>"Certainly I shall not," said my <i>Mother</i>,
still chafed. "I should be quite ashamed
of mentioning such a disgraceful Transaction
to him&mdash;worthier of a <i>Wapping</i>
Sailor than of his Brother's Son&mdash;Mate
to a respectable Merchant Vessel. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Thing only done by the Lowest of the
Low&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a few of the Highest of the
High," put in I.</p>

<p>"Who thereby reduce themselves to an
ignominious Level with the Lowest of
the Low," persisted my <i>Mother</i>. "It
ought to be put down by Act of Parliament!
It <i>will</i> shortly, I understand
from Dr. <i>Elwes</i>, who was speaking of
the Abuse a little While ago, little
thinking that a Culprit stood in his
Presence. I never could have believed
it of <i>Tom</i>! never have supposed that he
could so abuse a Mother's Confidence,
and sail off, leaving Dissimulation and
Discord behind him&mdash;he that used to
say 'he couldn't bear to put People to
the least Inconvenience!'"</p>

<p>At the Recurrence to this old Catch-Word
of his, <i>Prue</i> and I could neither of
us help bursting out laughing. My
<i>Mother</i>, quite against her Will, was obliged
to laugh too. At this Moment, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Door opened; and who should come in
but <i>Gatty</i>!</p>

<p>I sprang towards her, while <i>Prue</i>, with
a brief Word in passing, took the Opportunity
to escape.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of coming near
me?" said <i>Gatty</i> smiling, as I kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Oh no! <i>Our</i> Time came long ago;
no Danger of Infection here! But, dear
<i>Gatty</i>, we have been in such Suspense
about you! Have you not been ill?"</p>

<p>"No, I have been mercifully preserved&mdash;<i>James</i>
told me you had sent to inquire
how I was getting on; and as Lady
<i>Betty</i> is a good deal softened towards me
just now, I had not much Difficulty in
prevailing with her to let me come
out for a few Hours, and I thought I
would put your Fears at rest by coming
to you."</p>

<p>Finding she could stay, we made her
remove her damp Cloak and Calash, and
take an early Dish of Tea with us. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
had a long Fireside Chat; and my <i>Mother</i>
at length going up to my <i>Father</i>, who had
slept long, <i>Gatty</i> became more unreserved
with me, and I soon drew from her all
that had happened.</p>

<p>It appeared that Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> had
proposed to her during their Walk from
<i>Roaring House</i>; but she then considered
herself engaged for the Time to Lady
<i>Betty</i>, so as she could not in Honour nor
Justice draw back; and therefore she
would not hear of giving up her Journey
to Town, though she promised to give
Lady <i>Betty</i> Notice that she should leave
her Service as soon as her <i>Ladyship</i> was
suited. On the following Day, when
they journeyed together, Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
renewed his Suit, and obtained from her
that she would quit Lady <i>Betty</i> at the very
earliest Day she decently could; after
which they talked over their Prospect of
mutual Happiness with great Satisfaction,
till the Coach overturned. When <i>Gatty</i>
reached Town and found Lady <i>Betty</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Small-Pox, she was a good deal astounded,
not being quite clear whether she
were exempt from it or not; however, she
thought her Duty lay plainly before her,
and embraced it with as good a Grace as
she could. Being her <i>Ladyship's</i> sole Attendant,
her Post was arduous; however,
she filled it so as to secure very thorough
Satisfaction, though very little Gratitude;
Lady <i>Betty</i> being one of those who think
Gold can requite any Amount of Obligation;
at least, as far as the Lower Orders
are concerned. And what Amount of
Gold, then, had my <i>Lady</i> bestowed on the
young Creature who, under Providence,
had saved her Life at the Risk of her own?
An Annuity? A Purse full of Guineas?
No such Thing! An old Gold Snuff-Box,
presented to her <i>Ladyship's</i> Grandfather by
the obscure Members of some forgotten
Corporation! A Thing of no earthly Consideration
to her <i>Ladyship</i>; though <i>Gatty</i>
guessed that if sold by the Ounce, it might
fetch her seven or perhaps ten Guineas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lady <i>Betty</i> was in a dreadful Way
about her Face&mdash;all marked and seamed;
and her fine Complexion quite gone!
And though, <i>Gatty</i> said, 'twas hoped
when the Redness had gone off, that she
would not look so bad, yet the Disorder
had left an Impress of Ordinariness, of
Commoness behind it, as is not unfrequent,
that went sadly against the Stomach of my
<i>Lady</i>. And when I said I should have
thought that a Personage who set such
Store by herself, would have been blinded
by Self-prepossession, to any falling off,
<i>Gatty</i> said 'twas quite the other Way; for
her <i>Ladyship</i> was so well acquainted with
every good Point about her, that she was
Lynx-eyed to the smallest Deficience, and
more intolerant of it than any indifferent
Party could be. Whereby it befel that
she was ready to dash into Pieces every
Looking-glass in the House, and would
have them covered up, and would only sit
in a Chamber artfully darkened, and would
not for the Present let any Man get Sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of her, nor even any of her favourite
female Friends, though she was quite well
enough to receive them, so much dreaded
she their spreading disparaging Reports.
She meant to go down to some Watering-place
where she was unknown, and there
lead a hermetical Life directly the Weather
was fine enough; having a Notion that
the Sea Air would take off the Redness.
Meanwhile, she kept <i>Gatty</i> on hard Duty
all Day long, playing Picquet and reading
Novels; and <i>Gatty</i> said she only wished
they were in some Language she did not
understand, for she feared so much trashy
Reading must impair her Mind in spite of
her Repugnance to it. And when my
<i>Lady</i> had Nothing better to do, she
abused <i>Gatty</i> for not tying her Hands
when she was worst at all Hazards, rather
than let her tear at her Face like as one
would hackle Flax; averring it would
have been better to die than to live such a
Fright. However, <i>Gatty</i> said she knew
that had not been her <i>Ladyship's</i> Mind at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the Time, and she did not consider that
she should have been borne out in it. She
said she had now learnt at last the Value
of Lap-dogs and Parrots, for they helped
to divert Lady <i>Betty</i> from her mortifying
Reflections more than Anything else. And
there was this Good gained, that my Lady
now always made her begin and end the
Day with reading Prayers and a Chapter;
and though she did not seem to attend
much, yet Nobody knew but some good
Word might make itself heard at last.</p>

<p>Having thus relieved her Mind, <i>Gatty</i>
was inclined to hear of our own Affairs
while we were taking Tea. She was very
sorry to hear of my <i>Father's</i> sad Accident;
and, learning from <i>Prue</i> that he would be
very glad to shake Hands with her if she
did not mind going into his sick-Chamber,
where he was now promoted to an easy
Chair by the Fire, she stepped up to him
with me, and enlivened him for Half-an-Hour
with her cheerful Talk. Of course
he rallied her about Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was to be expected,&mdash;but she took it very
bravely, and gave him back Quip for
Crank; yet all so modest and innocent-spoken,
as the Jest of a Girl like <i>Gatty</i>
was certain to be. And somehow, by
Way of Lady <i>Betty</i>, she got round, quite
naturally, to Something serious, about
Life and Death, Judgment and Eternity,
that my <i>Father</i> took better of her than he
would have done from us, and that left us
all with our Minds in a State of serious
Composedness.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Mr. Honeywood's Convalescence.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Prue</i> and I made up our Books at
the Year's End, we found to our great
Thankfulness and Satisfaction, that in spite
of our having paid many heavy Bills of
my <i>Father's</i>, we were on the right Side
the Post, and had cleared a good Year's
Income. And this I told my <i>Father</i> in so
many Words, thinking it would please
him as well as ourselves.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said he; "'In spite of
having paid many of your <i>Father's</i>
heavy Bills.' This carries an ill Sound
with it. And the Sense is worse. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a Father grudges paying his thoughtless
Son's bills: well may industrious
Daughters grudge paying the Bills of a
thoughtless Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Father</i>! I'm sure we don't
grudge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>! If I'm falling
into a profitable and penitent State of
Mind, why should you hinder me? Do
you want Nobody to be good but yourself?
That's your Pride. I've got my
Share of Self-Knowledge and Humiliation,
I hope, as well as other People;
and when I say I've been thoughtless,
<i>Madam</i>, (smiting the Table with his
Fist,)  I seriously mean it!"</p>

<p>As Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> had just been talking
with him, I attributed this virtuous Self-Indignation
to his Influence, and only
hoped it might last. My <i>Father</i> and he
were now mighty Friends: although we
were so far from <i>Shoreditch</i>, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
stepped over to us at least once a Week,
saying he could not forget our Attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to himself during his Illness, and considered
us as a kind of Out-Parishioners.
On these Occasions he frequently spent an
Hour alone with my <i>Father</i>, and then
joined us at the Tea-Table, which was
profitable to the one Party and pleasant to
the other.</p>

<p>At Length, it became practicable to
remove my <i>Father</i> down Stairs. But
before this was accomplished, he beckoned
to my <i>Mother</i> and said, "<i>Delia</i>, I prithee
cover up or hide away all the China
Figures down Stairs before I come into
the <i>Chinese</i> Parlour, or they will bring
my Dream to Mind, and set me fancying
I see 'em all dancing. Anything but
that! I loathe the very Thought of
them!&mdash;You may sell them if you will&mdash;send
them to <i>Dick Harper</i> with my
Card, and they'll fetch a pretty Figure
at the next Auction, especially if you
throw in the Five Senses. Idle Baggages!
they led me astray, as they've led
many a better Man before me. Happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
he who can disembarrass himself from
their Extravagancies thus easily!"</p>

<p>My <i>Mother</i> did, in Fact, get a pretty
little Sum for them; and my <i>Father</i> never
bought another Piece of China nor attended
another Auction from that Day to
this. But this by the Way.</p>

<p>We were sitting very comfortably about
the Fire, congratulating ourselves upon
being thus re-united,&mdash;and my <i>Father</i> was
enjoying a Basin of strong Gravy Soup,
(for it was a little before Noon,) and
wishing my <i>Mother</i> would have a little of
it, when all at once down fell a Smelling-Bottle
from the Chimney-Piece; a Water-Caraffe
on the Table upset; Doors banged,
Bells rang without being pulled, the Walls
shook, and the Ground sank and rose under
us like a Ship at Sea. We shrieked out,
and clung to one another; and I, in addition
to my Terror, experienced great Nausea,
as if I were on Shipboard. My <i>Father</i>
immediately exclaimed, "Heyday! there's
a Powder-Mill blown up at <i>Hounslow</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"God pity the poor Creatures in and
about it," cries my <i>Mother</i>. The next
Moment, in rushes <i>Peter</i>, as white as a
Sheet.</p>

<p>"An Earthquake! an Earthquake!"
cries he, "Did you feel the Earthquake?"</p>

<p>"Earthquake? you Dolt," says my <i>Father</i>;
"'tis a Powder-Mill blown up at
<i>Hounslow</i>, I tell ye; and so you'll find
before To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," says <i>Peter</i>, "all the
Neighbours say as I do, and are scared
out of their Wits, expecting another
Shock presently, which, for Aught we
know, may swallow us up alive."</p>

<p>"<i>Peter</i>, you're an Oaf&mdash;a Lubber!"
says my <i>Father</i> contemptuously; on which
<i>Peter</i> retired; but <i>Prue</i>, who was much
frightened, began to cry.</p>

<p>"What's the use of crying, Chit?"
says my <i>Father</i>, "is that a Cure for an
Earthquake?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>Father</i>, but it's so very awful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very awful," said my <i>Mother</i>, seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very awful indeed," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, of course it would be, if it <i>were</i>
an Earthquake," says my <i>Father</i>; "but
I say 'twas only a Powder-Mill blowing
up somewhere, and so you'll see."</p>

<p>When the Apothecary who had set
<i>Father's</i> Leg came in, however, he confirmed
the general Opinion that there had
been a smart Shock of an Earthquake, and
added that it had been accompanied by
what we had not noticed, namely, a loud
crashing or crackling Noise. Everybody
that came into the Shop spoke about it;
and there was a general Uncomfortableness
and Sense of Insecurity.</p>

<p>In the Dusk of Evening, Dr. <i>Elwes</i>
looked in on us; and while he remained,
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> came in. Both spoke of the
Earthquake, though my <i>Father</i> would not
entirely give into it till it was positively
ascertained that no Mill had blown up.
Dr. <i>Elwes</i> said that the Shock had been
felt on both Sides of the River, as far as
<i>Greenwich</i>, and remarked that the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Phenomena of the last Month had surely
been such as to awaken the careless and
solemnize the thoughtful Mind.</p>

<p>"For Instance," says he, "the new
Year was ushered in by a very remarkable
Appearance in the Heavens, of a
dusky red Light that seemed to gather
into a Focus southward, emitting brilliant
Coruscations. I was warm in
Bed and asleep at the Time, but I heard
it from those who saw it, and it was in
the public Prints."</p>

<p>I here put in that I had seen it; being
on Watch over my <i>Father</i> at the Time,
who was then in his Deliration. I had
seen a red Light glowing through the
white Window-Curtains, and on going to
look out, perceived such a ruddy Glow in
the Sky that I had surmised a dreadful,
distant Fire somewhere. And again, a
few Weeks after, <i>Prue</i> and I were wakened
in the Night by such an awful Storm of
Thunder, Lightning, Rain, Sleet, and Hail,
accompanied by terrific Blasts of Wind, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
seemed to go nigh to shake the House to
Pieces.</p>

<p>"I slept through it all," said my <i>Father</i>.&mdash;"However,
<i>Patty</i> does not exaggerate,
for the Mischief done by that Tempest
at <i>Bristol</i> was immense, and filled the
Inhabitants with Consternation."</p>

<p>"I wonder what it all means," said
<i>Prudence</i> ruefully.</p>

<p>"Means!" repeated my <i>Father</i>, with
Contempt.</p>

<p>"It means that we should watch," said
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, mildly, "since our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will come at an Hour we know not of.
Many poor People in <i>Shoreditch</i> came
to me in great Alarm, to ask me if I
thought the End of the World was
coming. I told them I knew no more
then they did, for that of that Hour
knoweth no Man; no, not the Angels in
Heaven, but only the <span class="smcap">Father</span>; but that
what our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> had said to his own
Disciples, he had said unto all&mdash;'Watch!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>And he went on to speak of the Desirableness
and Duty of a continual State of
Preparedness for whatever might happen
to us from within or without, and the
Confidence with which Believers might
repose on the Care of their heavenly
<span class="smcap">Father</span>, with such Feeling and Power,
that all of us went to Bed that Night
in a State of chastened Composure, widely
apart from ungodly Indifference or slavish
Fear. There was more Solemnity and
Affection than usual in our Parting for
the Night; since we knew not but we
might be swallowed up quick like <i>Dathan</i>
and <i>Abiram</i> ere Morning Light, though
we humbly hoped, in that Case, to reopen
our Eyes in a better World.</p>

<p>This being our State of Mind, it was
with Disgust that I learnt on the following
Day, that the reckless Men of Fashion
and Quality who had supped Overnight at
<i>Bedford House</i>, had gone about the Town
on their Way Home, betwixt four and
five o'Clock in the Morning, knocking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Doors and mischievously frightening timid
harmless People, by bawling out, "Past
four o'Clock, and a dreadful Earthquake!"
"The Fool hath said in his
Heart, There is no <span class="smcap">God</span>!"</p>

<p>During the Remainder of this Month
we went on quietly enough, seeing few
Persons except in the Way of Business,
which, by Reason of the Severity of the
Season, was much slacker than in fine
Weather. My <i>Father</i> progressed so slowly
that we had our private Doubts whether
he were not invalided for Life. However,
from being one of the most impatient, he
had now become the most patient of
Men; so that 'twas quite a Pleasure to
nurse him. His gay Companions having
altogether forsook him in his Illness, he
was now grown totally indifferent to them,
and if one or other of them dropped in
on him, he treated them with so much
sardonic Irony that they were unlikely to
intrude very soon on him again. He
missed 'em very little, having now taken a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
great Fancy to reading, and to the Company
of my <i>Mother</i>, both of which were
very safe and inexpensive Luxuries. He
had grown singularly fond of Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
and of Dr. <i>Elwes</i>, the latter of whom
frequently honoured us by dropping in to
play a Rubber&mdash;they were Men of two
different Worlds, but yet neither of them
so unacquainted with the World that was
characteristically the other's, as to be
wholly unable to make Allowances:&mdash;one
brought my <i>Father</i> worldly Wisdom and
Wit, the other heavenly Wisdom and innocent
Pleasantry; one supplied him with
humorous Books, the other, with profitable
Reading; so that, between 'em both,
he fared not badly. He was now getting
through the History of <i>Don Quixote de la
Mancha</i>, which he read Snatches of with
infinite Gusto to my <i>Mother</i>; and was
continually quoting the Proverbs of <i>Sancho
Panza</i>. Thus we went peacefully on,
and were losing all Fear or even Memory
of the Earthquake; when, on the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
same Day of the very next Month, which
is to say, <i>February 1750</i>, we were affrighted
out of our Senses by a worse Shock and
abundantly more terrifical, between Five
and Six o'Clock in the Morning. Oh!
how <i>Prue</i> and I shrieked out, and rushed
down, half dressed, to my <i>Father</i> and
<i>Mother</i>. They were sitting up in Bed,
having been woke out of Sleep by a loud,
rumbling Noise, accompanied by thick,
low Flashes of Lightning. The House
was still rocking and the Ground heaving
all about us, Bells ringing, Clocks striking,
Glass and China jingling, and Furniture
shifting from one Place to another. My
<i>Father</i> was this Time seriously frightened,
and cried, "Come to my Arms, my Children,
and let us die together&mdash;we heeded
not the first Warning. 'Tis as well to
meet our Fate here, all together, as anywhere
else, since whither could we flee
from Danger? even if I were an able-bodied
Man, which I am not. Good
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, deliver us. Because there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
none other that can help us, but only
thou, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!"</p>

<p>So I remained folded in his Arms, and
<i>Prue</i> in my <i>Mother's</i>, while we heard
Persons in wild Affright loudly shrieking
in the open Air. I have often thought
since, that had Death indeed come upon
us at that Moment, it would have been
attended with much Mitigation of its
Bitterness.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the Vibration having ceased,
we slowly withdrew from one another's
Arms, with deep-drawn Breaths; and set
about dressing and resuming the Occupations
of the Day in strange Discomfort
and Sadness. I have since read, in Books
of Travellers, that in Countries where
Earthquakes are prevalent, the Natives are
in many Instances far more consternated
by them than Strangers, who being unaccustomed
to them do not in one View
concentrate all their disastrous Consequences.
This I can well believe; for
certainly all <i>London</i> was infinitely more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
appalled by this second Shock than by the
first. How can I convey any Figure of
the Impressions of Fear and Superstition?
how describe the alarmed Consciences of
Sinners, the Perturbation of grave Men,
the Distress of tender <i>Mothers</i>, the Cries
of affrighted Children at a Danger so
novel and Stupendous? To increase the
general Panic, while godly Preachers like
Bishop <i>Sherlock</i> and Bishop <i>Secker</i> were
endeavouring to improve the Judgment to
Purposes of Penitence and Piety among
the upper Ranks, and good Ministers like
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> were calling on the lower
Orders to repent and be saved, a fanatic
Itinerant began preaching in the Streets,
and boldly prophesying another Shock on
the same Day of <i>April</i>, which would
swallow up all <i>London</i>. The Impression
produced by this Prediction was such as
that Churches now filled to overflowing,
Public-Houses were deserted, good Books
were read, Alms liberally bestowed on the
Poor, and the Sick and them that lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Prison visited. O that such Deeds of
Humanity had sprung from some better
Principle than selfish Fear! "Ah," says
one poor Man lying in <i>Newgate</i>, "I expect
that when the next Earthquake occurs,
my Chains, like those of <i>St. Paul</i>, will
fall off." "Let us eat and drink," cries
another tipsily, "for To-morrow we die!"&mdash;"I
can't help fearing this next Shock that
is to happen in <i>April</i>," says a poor Wretch
in the Hospital that is sure not to live out
the Week. "Ah," says a meek Patient in
the next Bed, placidly smiling, "I shall be
out of Harm's Way before that comes!"</p>

<p>Others combated their Neighbours'
Fears with Reason and Ridicule; others
drowned Thought altogether in additional
Excess of Riot. I understood from <i>Gatty</i>
that many smart Things were said about
the Earthquake in the upper Circles; and
every fresh Instance of a fine Lady caring
for her Soul and going to Prayers elicited
Fits of modish Laughter. And yet, who
deserved the Judgment of Heaven to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
upon them, if the Rich did not? whose
Dissoluteness and Disregard of Decency
and Order had now come to that Pass as
quite to paravaunt over the Vices and
Crimes of the common Orders. <span class="smcap">God's</span>
sacred Name habitually blasphemed,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> and the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> ignored,
the <i>Devil</i> disbelieved, Chastity laughed at,
Ribaldry approved, Drunkenness considered
Good-Breeding, Servants treated as if not
of the same Flesh and Blood with themselves,
Sabbaths desecrated, Gambling
carried to an incredible Extent, the Hanging
of poor Wretches at <i>Tyburn</i> counted a
Spectacle worthy to recreate Noblemen,
public Honour a mere Name, Patriotism
the Synonyme for revolutionary Principle,
no Truth, nor Honour, nor Justice, in
Court nor in public Offices ... who,
then, had Reason to dread the just Judgments
of <span class="smcap">God</span>?</p>

<p>At the very Time the Earth was rocking
with the first Shock, there were profane
Scoffers in Club-houses who would bet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
whether it were an Earthquake or the
Explosion of a Gunpowder Magazine.
At the very Time two-thirds of <i>London</i>
were on their Knees, observing a general
Fast and Day of Humiliation, the Gambling-houses
were filled with Members of
Parliament, who found themselves with a
Day of Leisure on their Hands. A Man
dropped down Dead at the Door of <i>White's</i>
Coffee-house: he was carried in; the Club
immediately made Bets whether he were
dead or not; a Surgeon came in to bleed
him; the Wagerers interposed, saying it
would affect the Fairness of the Bet!</p>

<p>O Madness of mortal Men! O Hardness,
past Belief, of impenitent Sinners!</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII.</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Night of Terror.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the dreaded Day approached, the public
Panic increased to that Degree, that even
the Sceptics with a Scoff on their Lips
thought it would be as well to "keep
out of Harm's Way," and "Follow the
Fashion." Not that they intended Penitence
and Self-recollection, no, no; but
since <i>London</i> was to be swallowed up, they
would take Lodgings, that Night, in the
Country.</p>

<p>In Consequence of this, every one that
had a Room or Bed to let, in <i>Chelsea</i>,
<i>Hammersmith</i>, <i>Kensington</i>, <i>Kew</i>, <i>Richmond</i>,
or anywhere within a moderate Distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the Metropolis, raised their Prices to an
immoderate Height; and in every little
Shop or Parlour Window a Card or Paper,
ill writ and ill spelt, might be seen pasted
or wafered, notifying that "Hear might
be had a Bedd or Bedds on the ensewing
Nite of the Erthquak." Nay, Women
whose Fortunes or Occupations did not
admit of their leaving their City Homes,
quilted themselves warm "Earthquake
Bedgowns," in which to take Flight in the
Night, if their Houses should tumble
about their Ears.</p>

<p>It might be about a Week before
the Event was expected, and while the
Churches were daily filled to overflowing,
that <i>Gatty</i> came to inquire whether her
<i>Lady</i> could have the Sitting-room and
Bed-chamber formerly occupied by Mr.
<i>Fenwick</i>, for "the Earthquake Night."
Though the Apartments were unlet, my
<i>Mother</i> did not much relish Lady <i>Betty</i> for
her Guest, even for twenty-four Hours,
and said she did not know she was minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to let the Rooms at all; she was sure we
could not do Things to my <i>Lady's</i> liking.
However, <i>Gatty</i>, who was to be Lady
<i>Betty's</i> Companion, and had a great Fancy
for coming to us on her own Account,
said she was instructed to offer us any
Price within Reason, and of her own
Head offered so handsome a Sum, that my
<i>Mother</i> said she should be ashamed of
taking it for one Night. There was
Nothing in that, <i>Gatty</i> said; Lady <i>Betty</i>
never grudged any Money on herself, and
could well afford to pay it, and would
rather like boasting beforehand and afterwards,
how much her Earthquake Lodgings
cost her. So, as we well knew all
our Neighbours were making the same
Market, and we should really be disaccommodated
by having her <i>Ladyship</i> and finding
a Lodging for Mr. <i>James</i>, we would
not be so nice as to hold out, but accepted
the Terms in consideration of the Trouble.
I should, indeed, have put in a Proviso for
Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, whose Safety was infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
more important than my <i>Lady's</i>, had I
believed there was the least Chance of his
consenting to occupy his old Quarters;
but I knew already that he would by no
Means forsake his poor People in <i>Shoreditch</i>,
even on the Supposal of any especial
Dangerousness on that Night, which he
did not, averring the mysterious Intentions
of Providence to be altogether hidden out
of Sight, in spite of the Presagings of
Impostors and Fanatics.</p>

<p><i>Gatty</i> joyfully left us therefore, having,
she owned, been a little infected by the
Fears of those around her, which were
especially prevalent in the Servants' Hall,
where the poor Maids and Men were to be
left in their ordinary Charge; my <i>Lady</i>
not entertaining the same Fear of their
being swallowed up alive as of herself.</p>

<p>And was it not strange, now, that a
Lady who might have commanded the
Use of various Country Seats, or have
hired an entire House somewhere in the
remoter Parts by the Week, for about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
same Sum she was to pay for a single
Night, should prefer her own selfish Accommodation
before that of her whole
Household? But, I am sorry to say,
hers was not a singular Case.</p>

<p>The Bustle into which we and our
Neighbours were put, by the Expectance
of our Quality-Lodgers, had Something
in it strangely dissonant to the Occasion.
Here were Carts arriving at the Door with
my <i>Lady's</i> own Feather-Bed and Blankets,
my <i>Lady's</i> own Linen and Toilette, my
<i>Lady's</i> own Cushions and Foot-stool, even
my <i>Lady's</i> own Parrot: and Wine, and
Cordials, and Sweetmeats, and <i>Packs of
Cards</i>; though the Supper was to be
provided by us, "for the good of the
House." It seemed that though my
<i>Lady</i> intended to be only a Mile or two
beyond the Prospect of burying alive, and
within Sound and Sight of an engulfed
City, she by no Means purposed a reflective
Watch and Pause while the Crisis impended,
but rather thought to kill Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and drown Fear by Jollity and Entertainment.
To this End, she invited certain
of her Intimates, including Mr. <i>Paul Caryl</i>,
(for she had got tired of keeping the Men
at a Distance,) who had likewise secured
Lodgings in <i>Chelsea</i>, to spend the Evening
with her, and pursue their Diversions far
into the Night.</p>

<p>We were not to expect her till the
Afternoon previous to the Occasion; but
however, shoals of poor, terrified People
who had engaged Lodgings in remoter and
less expensive Parts, could not be hindered
of pouring into the Country for two or
three Days beforehand; and as every
imaginable Vehicle was pressed into the
Service, all the Highroads and leading
Thoroughfares of <i>London</i> were absolutely
blockaded with Coaches, Chaises, and
Chairs, as well as innumerable Foot-Passengers,
often inextricably wedged together
for ten or fifteen Minutes. One Family,
I understood, even took Flight in a Hearse:
indeed, Dr. <i>Elwes</i> said it could be likened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to Nothing but the consternated Flight
that took place at the Beginning of the
Great Plague. He added, that the Fields
were full of People preparing to Camp
out for the Night; just as they were
constrained to do after the Fire of <i>London</i>;
and finished by observing with an ironical
Laugh, "There's a good Time coming for
the Doctors; for plenty of Colds will
be caught to-night in the wet Fields,
to say Nothing of damp Lodgings."</p>

<p>About five o'Clock in the Afternoon,
my <i>Lady</i> arrived in her Coach. She was
handed out by her Nephew, Mr. <i>Sandys</i>,
and her Physician Dr. <i>Plumptree</i>; and
<i>Gatty</i> followed with the Lap-Dog. Her
<i>Ladyship</i> wore a cherry-colour Sacque
and large Straw Hat; but neither the
Shadow of the one nor the hue of the
other could conceal how her Beauty was
ruinated by her sad Complaint. She was
no longer even ordinarily comely; all her
fine red and white and smooth Skin lost,
and her Eyes bleared and spoilt. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
much Fuss we got her settled in the upper
Parlour; but to say Nothing of her own
two Servants, she contrived, the whole of
the Time she was under our Roof, to keep
<i>Prue</i> and me continually on the Trot.
Inquiry soon was made for Mr. <i>Caryl</i>; he
had not appeared: my <i>Lady</i> was disappointed;
she had expected him to be the
Life of the Party. By-and-by, in spite
of her Shawls and Cushions, she fancied
a Draught from the Window; I was
summoned to cure it, and had to cobble
an additional Breadth of Dimity to the
Curtain as quickly as I could; while
my <i>Lady</i> stroked her Lap-Dog at the
Fire, and chatted with her two Companions.</p>

<p>"Awfully cold," says the <i>Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>"Screaming cold," says the <i>Nephew</i>.
"These inferior Houses always have thin
Walls; one might think it was <i>January</i>.
To-night, all <i>London's</i> out of Town&mdash;Lady
<i>Frances Arundel</i>, and Lord and
Lady <i>Galway</i> have gone ten Miles into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the Country, to play Brag till five in the
Morning, and then come back."</p>

<p>"A good many will play Brag," said
the <i>Doctor</i>, simpering&mdash;"the real Braggarts,
I think, are those that stay behind."</p>

<p>"Then you really <i>are</i> afraid, <i>Doctor</i>?"
says Lady <i>Betty</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, my <i>Lady</i>, I think it would be
a Tempting of Providence to incur any
Risk needlessly."</p>

<p>Just then, in came Mr. <i>Caryl</i>. "A
thousand Excuses," says he. "I was
coming along the <i>Five Fields</i>, when a
couple of crazy old Houses tumbled
down and blocked up the Way, so I
was obliged to come round."</p>

<p>"A lucky Escape for you, <i>Paul</i>," says
Mr. <i>Sandys</i>, "it might have been as bad
for you as an Earthquake."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," says Mr. <i>Caryl</i>, "though
not easily fluttered, it did give me a
Qualm, I confess. Besides, it might
have been a premonitory Quake that
brought the Houses down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"My Salts, <i>Gatty</i>!" cries Lady <i>Betty</i>.</p>

<p>"Any Casualties?" says the <i>Doctor</i>
carelessly.</p>

<p>"To tell you the Truth," says Mr.
<i>Caryl</i>, "I was so rejoiced to save my own
Bones that I did not stop to inquire
whether anyone else had theirs broken."
And lightly laughed.</p>

<p>"Feeling!" mutters Mr. <i>Sandys</i>.</p>

<p>"Quack!" responds Mr. <i>Caryl</i> softly.</p>

<p>And then I knew them, that Moment,
for the Fox and the Goose!</p>

<p>"Whereabouts in the <i>Five Fields</i> did
it happen?" resumes the <i>Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>"Just by that old, empty House, <i>Doctor</i>,
wherein two Women were found starved
to Death with Cold and Hunger, somewhere
about <i>Christmas</i>."</p>

<p>"I'm sure such Things as that ought
not to occur," says Lady <i>Betty</i>, dabbing
her Forehead with some Essence, "so well
as the Poor are provided for."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, especially this <i>Christmas</i>,"
says Mr. <i>Sandys</i> carelessly&mdash;"for, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
know, a great many Hogs were seized
by the Church-wardens and Overseers
of <i>St. George's</i> Parish, that were kept in
private Houses and Yards contrary to the
Statute made and provided; whereby
the Poor, of that Parish at least, if they
had not their <i>Christmas</i> Beef, had their
<i>Christmas</i> Pork; for it was distributed
among them."</p>

<p>"Not gratis, though," said the <i>Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>"No, but very cheap;" said Mr. <i>Sandys</i>.
"So I understood."</p>

<p>"I wonder you should understand or
hear Anything about it, <i>Harry</i>," says
Lady <i>Betty</i> contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Aunt</i>, I happened to hear it
named by Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>."</p>

<p>"When is Mr. <i>Arbuthnot</i> to marry
Lady <i>Grace</i>?" says Mr. <i>Caryl</i>.</p>

<p>"After Lent, I believe," said the <i>Doctor</i>,&mdash;"They
that marry in <i>Lent</i> will live to
repent."</p>

<p>"Why so?" says Lady <i>Betty</i>.</p>

<p>"Nay, Madam, ask your Chaplain. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
suppose People should not be feasting
when they ought to be fasting."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it, no Doubt," says Lady
<i>Betty</i>&mdash;"Let us have Tea now, <i>Gatty</i>;
and Plenty of <i>Genoa</i> Macaroons."</p>

<p>The next Time I went up Stairs, which
was not till after Dark, they were all playing
at Brag.</p>

<p>As I went down, a sudden Blast of
Wind from the front Door of the House
blew my Candle out, and I groped along
into the Shop, muttering, "Who on Earth
can be standing in the Draught such a
cold Night as this?" At the same Moment
I caught a Glimpse of a Couple of
dusky Figures standing in the Doorway,
and heard, in earnest Under-tones, the
Words, "<i>Gatty!</i> is that you?" "Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i>! can it be you? What in the
World can have brought you here, and
at this Time of Night?"&mdash;"To be with
you, dearest <i>Gatty</i>, in case of your being
alarmed, and&mdash;and&mdash;in case of Anything
happening...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>I would not overhear another Word,
but went straight into the Parlour and lit
my Candle, saying quietly to my <i>Mother</i>,
"There's Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> outside, talking to
<i>Gatty</i>."</p>

<p>"Have him in!" cries my <i>Father</i>,
whose Ears were quicker than I thought,
"I want to see what the young Chap is
like."&mdash;"Hush, <i>Father</i>, he'll overhear
you&mdash;Maybe he will prefer saying a few
Words to <i>Gatty</i> by herself first." "Very
likely, very likely," says my <i>Father</i>
chuckling&mdash;"but I hope he won't go
away without coming in, for all that."</p>

<p>I now thought I might go out again
with the Candle, and set it in the Shop;
but the Current of Air from the Door
again nearly blew it out, though I screened
it with my Hand. The Stream of Light
fell upon <i>Gatty</i>, who turned about and
said, "<i>Patty</i>, here's an old Acquaintance,&mdash;I'm
sure I may ask him in, may not I?"
"And welcome," said I. "I am almost
too dirty to be seen," says Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
coming in. "Why, you are all muddy
from Head to Foot," cries <i>Gatty</i>,
"What <i>can</i> you have been doing?"</p>

<p>Just then, Lady <i>Betty's</i> Bell was pulled
pretty sharply, and <i>Gatty</i> was obliged to
run off. I could see, by Mr. <i>Heavitree's</i>
wincing, that he could not abide the Remembrance
of her menial Position, and
that it would not be his Fault if she long
retained it. I ushered him into the Parlour.
My <i>Father</i>, in his easy Chair,
stretches out his Hand to him. "Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i>," says he heartily, "I'm glad
to see you." "You see a very dirty
Fellow, Sir," says Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> laughing.
"Why, you <i>are</i> dirty, indeed," says
my <i>Father</i>, surveying him; "is this the
Way you come a-courting? I should
say you had been rolling in the Gutter."
"Something like it," says Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>;
"we Country Folks got feared by this
Talk of the Earthquake, so I thought
I'd just come up to Town and look after
<i>Gatty</i>; but, Sir, what a Place this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
<i>London</i> is! My Danger along the Road,
of being attacked by the Fellow they call
the Flying Highwayman, was nothing
to what it was when I got into the
Streets. I put up my Horse at an Inn,
and then set forth, as clean as you'd wish
to see me, to Lady <i>Betty's</i>, where I expected
to find <i>Gatty</i>; but it was already
getting dark, and by Reason of the Panic
the Town was almost deserted except by
the very worst Sort, who care neither
for Heaven nor Earth, and who seemed
minded to make the Desertion of Houses
an Occasion for pretty general Plunder.
Here and there twinkled a miserable little
solitary Oil Lamp; here and there a Lantern
flitted across, or a Ray of a Tallow
Candle streamed from some Window, but
with these Exceptions, which only seemed
to make Darkness more dismal, there was
Nothing to prevent one from breaking
one's Shins against Posts and Door-Steps,
or walking straight into the Gutters. I
was hustled once or twice, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
think Affairs were not much mended
since my <i>Lord Mayor</i> and the <i>Aldermen</i>
went up to the <i>King</i>. Suddenly I was
pounced on by three disorderly Fellows,
who collared me and dragged me into a
dark Cellar. One of them held a Lantern
to my Face and said, '<i>Jem</i>, this
isn't our Man,' on which I was pushed
out pretty near as roughly as I was
pulled in. This did not hinder me of
taking to my Heels, which occasioned
my stumbling into an enormous Heap
of wet Mud by the Side of the Foot-Path,
with ne'er a Lamp near it, which
made me in the Pickle you see. However,
I got to Lady <i>Betty's</i>, where I
found the Mansion deserted by all save
one poor Maid, who sate reading of her
Bible by the Light of a Kitchen Candle;
all the rest having decamped as soon
as my <i>Lady</i> was off, in the Opinion
that their Safety was quite as dear
to them as hers to her. I asked the
poor Creature if she were not afeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
be alone at such a Crisis; but she seemed
to be Something of a Predestinarian, and
said her Time could come but once, and
when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> would; she could trust
herself in his Hands. I obtained from
her that <i>Gatty</i> and my <i>Lady</i> had gone to
the <i>Chelsea Bun-House</i>; so then I knew
they were with <i>you</i>, Mrs. <i>Patty</i>; and
having got a Direction to <i>Chelsea</i>, I soon
made out, when I reached it, my Way
here. But oh, what a State all the
Fields and waste Grounds about you are
in! People in Tents, Booths, Carts,
Coaches, and Caravans; awaiting the
Morning Light. The Field Preachers
are busy among them, and are exhorting
attentive Multitudes: but will the Impression
survive To-morrow?&mdash;I think,
Sir, my Mud is dry now; and if you
will lend me a Clothes-Brush, I'll step
out and groom myself a little."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XIX.</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Vigil.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"That's</span> as good-looking a young Man,"
says my <i>Father</i>, "as ever I saw&mdash;quite
a Mate for <i>Gatty</i>."</p>

<p>"Hush, <i>Father</i>, he'll hear you," says
<i>Prue</i> softly.</p>

<p>"He can't," says <i>Father</i>, lowering his
Voice, however.</p>

<p>"How provoking it must be to <i>Gatty</i>,"
says <i>Prue</i>, "to know he is here, and yet
be kept in attendance on my Lady!"</p>

<p>"Tush, Child, she'd rather know he
was here than not.... Well, Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i>," (when our Visitor returned,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
"have you considered where you are to
get a Bed to-night?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Sir, really I have not."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you! You may take
your Choice of all the Beds in this
House except Lady <i>Betty's</i>; for we are
all going to sit up!"</p>

<p>"Why, then, Sir, with your Leave,
I'll sit up too!"</p>

<p>"Do so, young Gentleman, and welcome.
You see, we have quality Lodgers
in the House, who keep late
Hours; and as they require a good Deal
of waiting on, we think it best to sit up&mdash;'Tis
but for one Night."</p>

<p>"Besides which," put in my <i>Mother</i>,
"though we are not ourselves apprehensive
of an Earthquake this Night any more
than any other, yet having such a fresh
Recollection of the Terror we experienced
during the last Shock, and knowing
that so many Thousands of People
are in distressing Apprehension of a
similar and more terrible Occurrence, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
seems unfeeling to think of sleeping and
taking one's natural Rest, instead of
watching with others, and sympathising
with them."</p>

<p>"I think precisely as you do, Madam,"
said Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>; "I assure you that
though I am not of those who expect
the Earthquake, I am disposed for Anything
but Levity, and feel this to be an
impressive Occasion."</p>

<p>So, this being his acknowledged Feeling,
we sate about the Fire and fell into a
somewhat graver Strain of Conversation
than usual; and I was glad to find that
the young Man could talk seriously as well
as pleasantly. Though he had not let fall
a Word about want of Refreshment, I
knew he must have been fasting for some
Time, and therefore helped him plentifully
to cold Beef with his Tea and Bread and
Butter, which he pronounced very acceptable.
While he was eating, <i>Gatty</i> returned,
all Smiles, and said, "I am glad to
see you doing so well, Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
but just as he had made Room for her
beside him, tinkle went the Bell, and
away she was obliged to run again.</p>

<p>"Can't we muffle that Bell?" says he,
somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then my <i>Lady</i> would hammer on the
Floor," said I, "and would keep her
up-Stairs altogether."</p>

<p>"Yes," says <i>Father</i>, "that would answer
as ill as the two Housemaids in
<i>sop's</i> Fables, that killed the Cock for
waking their Mistress."</p>

<p>"Well," says Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>, "it won't
be for long, that's one Blessing. Her
Time's up on Monday, and I shall stay
in Town till then, and take her down
with me in the old Coach."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't have so many
overturns this Time," said my <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"Why, no," said he smiling, "we can
dispense with them now; but I protest
that Snow-Journey was the pleasantest
I ever had in my Life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going to possess a Treasure,
Sir," said my <i>Father</i> energetically.</p>

<p>"Indeed I think so, Sir! I was not
aware you so well knew her Value."</p>

<p>"Always took to her, Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>,
from the very first; Didn't I, Girls?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you did, <i>Father</i>."</p>

<p>"And when is it to be?" says my <i>Father</i>
significantly.</p>

<p>"Nay, Sir," said Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> with a
little Embarrassment, "I've not got <i>Gatty</i>
to name the Day yet, but I hope it will
be before long; and as my Sister <i>Clarissa</i>
is shortly to be married, which will
deprive <i>Roaring House</i> of its present
Mistress, perhaps we may arrange to
have two Weddings on the same Day."</p>

<p>"Was that poor Wayfarer found under
the Snow?" said my <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Ma'am, we conclude she accomplished
her Journey in Safety."</p>

<p>By-and-by, <i>Gatty</i> joined us again; and
we all sate chatting till Twelve o'Clock.
Then my <i>Lady's</i> Supper went up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
then we had our own; a pretty substantial
one, as watching makes People hungry.</p>

<p>After Supper, we, according to Custom,
had Prayers; and I thought it not amiss
to select for our Evening Portion the
twenty-fourth Chapter of St. <i>Matthew</i>,
which speaks of Famines, Pestilences, and
Earthquakes. After this, we again drew
round the Fire; for Watching makes
people chilly: and Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> began
to repeat some Reports he had gathered,
of the wretched State our Gaols were in,
at that Time, overflowing with the Refuse
of our Army and Navy, who, for Want of
honest Employment, were perishing miserably
amidst the Stench and Horrors of
noisome Dungeons.</p>

<p>"That they are," says my <i>Father</i>; "and
as for <i>Newgate</i>, it is now in so pestilential
a State of Infection from the
overcrowding together of dirty, starving
Felons, that the Effluvium they have
brought into Court on their Trials hath
cost us the Lives of a Lord Mayor, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Alderman, two Judges, divers Lawyers,
the greater Part of the Jury, and I
know not how many of the Bystanders.
This Spread of the Gaol Fever among
the upper Classes will do more to get
the Abuse remedied than the Deaths of
Hundreds of Criminals in their Cells;
but yet I can't for the Life of me help
regretting that so many able-bodied Men,
whose Labour might be serviceable to
the Community, should be idling at the
public Expense in Prison."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Heavitree</i> was silent, and <i>Gatty</i>
presently asked him what he was musing
about. He said, "Those Rogues who
pulled me into the dark Cellar said I
was not the right Man. I was wondering
if they have found him yet, and
what they have done to him."</p>

<p>This led to sundry dismal Stories, of
Footpads and Street-Assassins; and of
Lord <i>Harborough's</i> being beset by Robbers
in <i>Piccadilly</i> in broad Daylight, and one of
the Chairmen pulling a Pole out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
<i>Lordship's</i> Chair and knocking down one
of the Villains, while the Earl, leaping
out, and drawing his Sword, put the Rest
to flight. Then we wondered whether
Times could get worse, and whether they
would ever mend, and whether the next
Generation would listen to such Facts as
idle Tales, or whether Abuses would increase
to that Degree as to bring down a
Providential Judgment on the City, like
that which overtook <i>Gomorrah</i>, or like
that which we were now expecting.</p>

<p>Soon after this, my <i>Father</i> fell fast
asleep, and my <i>Mother</i> began to nod.
<i>Prudence</i> was knitting with all her Might,
and I took up my <i>Mother's</i> Knotting, and
on Pretence of getting nearer the Light,
edged my Chair further off from <i>Gatty</i>,
who continued conversing with Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
in an under Tone, which became lower
and lower. I am persuaded neither of
them felt in the least sleepy, nor had the
smallest Apprehensions of the Earthquake;
but <i>Prue</i> yawned awfully from Time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Time, and I was profoundly silent and very
serious.</p>

<p>All at once, Lady <i>Betty's</i> Bell rang
violently, and <i>Gatty</i> ran up Stairs. The
Wax Lights had burned out, and at first it
seemed that there were no others, which
put my <i>Lady</i> into a sad Taking. The
Idea of her being <i>left in the Dark with an
Earthquake</i>! Happily, another Pacquet
of Wax Candles was found, and, after
Ratafia had been served round, they fell
to their Card-playing again; but <i>Gatty</i>
affirmed that my <i>Lady</i> changed Colour,
and laid down her Hand on Mr. <i>Sandys's</i>
roguishly shaking the Table.</p>

<p>At Length, all the Clocks struck Five;
at which Hour everybody conceived themselves
safe, as witlessly as they had previously
held themselves to be in Danger.
The Card-Party now broke up; <i>Gatty</i>
went to undress my <i>Lady</i>, and I went to
lock out the Gentlemen, who departed
in a Body, looking fagged and haggard
enough. Just as Mr. <i>Caryl</i> was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
forth, he paused for a Moment and said,
"By-the-bye, this is where Mr.&mdash;Mr.
what's his Name? Mr. <i>Fenwick</i> lodged&mdash;Can
you tell me where he is at present,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>?"</p>

<p>I coolly answered, "With his poor
People in <i>Shoreditch</i>, Sir."</p>

<p>"<i>Shoreditch? Shoreditch?</i> Ha, I'll try
to remember that," says he carelessly;
and turned on his Heel. I thought to
myself, I don't believe you will; your Cue
is to forget.</p>

<p>Then I went to get my <i>Father</i> and
<i>Mother</i> to Bed, and send off <i>Prue</i>, and
lastly, to go to Bed myself. As for Mr.
<i>Heavitree</i>, he was content with a couple
of Chairs by the Fire. <i>Gatty</i> slept with
my <i>Lady</i>, who did not feel brave enough
to be alone.</p>

<p>The Watch made us all latish, and
arise yawnish. <i>Peter</i> told me the Roads
were all astir before Light, with People
returning to their Homes; and that the
Preachers were trying to enforce on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Penitents that they had had an Answer to
Prayer. Lady <i>Betty</i> did not rise till Noon;
what with her Vapours, her Whims, and
her Breakfast, she did not depart till two
o'Clock. We had scarcely a Word of
<i>Gatty</i>, but she ran in to us just at last, and
kissed us all round, taking Leave of us
once for all, and receiving our good
Wishes for her future Happiness with
many Blushes and Smiles. Mr. <i>Heavitree</i>
had already gone off; and as soon as we
had tidied my <i>Lady's</i> Rooms, we all subsided
into our usual Quiet.</p>

<p>The following Day, about Noon, I was
behind the Counter, when I received a
great Shock by hearing a Customer say
casually, "Dr. <i>Elwes</i> is dead&mdash;he went
off quite suddenly at six this Morning."</p>

<p>I could hardly go on weighing some
Comfits, the Tears crowded so fast into
my Eyes at the unexpected Loss of our
old Friend. I remained but to have the
ill News confirmed and gather the Particulars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and then went up to break them
to my <i>Mother</i>, who was sitting with my
<i>Father</i> in their own Chamber. She was
a good deal affected, and my <i>Father</i> undertook
the Office of Consoler with great
Kindliness. After a While I went down
and asked <i>Prue</i>, who felt less Concern
than I did for the <i>Doctor</i>, to take my
Place a little While in the Shop. Then
I went and sate down in the Parlour, and
thought over his various Acts of Kindness
to me, and shed some Tears of unaffected
Regret. He had never been a decidedly
religious Character, but was much liked
by his Patients, deservedly loved by the
Poor, and to us had been a tried and
valued Friend.</p>

<p>While I was in this sorrowful Mood,
in comes Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, so flushed with
Exercise and good Spirits as to look quite
handsome. Feeling so low as I did just
then, I did not reciprocate his Salutation
quite so cheerfully as he seemed to expect;
and he, on his Part, on finding that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i> were well, paid less
Attention to my Depression than he might
have done; and, for the first Time in my
Life, I thought him a little selfish.</p>

<p>"I have some good News," said he.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said I, "for I
have some bad News."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said he.</p>

<p>"Our dear Friend Dr. <i>Elwes</i> is dead;"
and I put the Corner of my Apron to my
Eyes.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I am sorry to hear it," resumes
he, after a Pause; "he was not, I fear, a
very thoughtful Man."</p>

<p>"A very <i>good</i> Man," said I, warming.</p>

<p>"A very kindly, attentive Man in a
Sick-room," says he, "and a pleasant
Companion, which is all I know about
him."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> knew a good Deal more," said I,
"and know that his Loss won't be soon
supplied. We shall miss him very much.
He was truly benevolent, whatever you
may think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't deny it, I assure you," said he,
looking surprised at my Heat, "I only
wished there had been a more Christian
Basis for his many good Qualities."</p>

<p>"It is not very Christian, I think, to
depreciate them, especially at a Time like
this."</p>

<p>"My dear <i>Patty</i>, I stand reproved. I
did not sufficiently consider, nor, indeed,
sufficiently know the Wound your Feelings
had just experienced."</p>

<p>This touched me, and I said, "We will
speak of it no more, Sir. I am glad to
see you looking so well. You told me, I
think, you had heard some good News."</p>

<p>"Yes, from Mr. <i>Caryl</i>."</p>

<p>"Quack!" said I hastily; losing my
Temper and good Manners in my revived
Impression of that Gentleman's Duplicity
and Hollowness.</p>

<p>"<i>Patty!</i>" said Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>, in a Tone
of mild Surprise.</p>

<p>"I beg your Pardon, Sir," said I,
ashamed of myself, "but you know I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
never can hear that Gentleman's Name
with Patience."</p>

<p>"I do know it," said he, smiling very
pleasantly, "and should retort on you the
Accusation of Uncharitableness, or else
endeavour to laugh you out of your
singular Prejudice against him, but that
I feel Something in it so flattering to
myself, that I am disarmed. However,
I have that to tell you of him now,
which will, I fancy, alter your Opinion."</p>

<p>"Nothing will alter my Opinion of
him," persisted I, "no Good will ever
come to you from that Quarter."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I know him better than you
do." He laughed.</p>

<p>"You may laugh, Sir," said I, "but
you'll see in Time that I am right.
Have you seen him lately?"</p>

<p>"Not since I was in this House."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I have seen him more than
once&mdash;I've seen him and heard him
among his own Set, when he didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
know I was by, and he said Things that ... convinced
me he was a false
Friend to you."</p>

<p>"What were those Things?"</p>

<p>"I'm not clear that I have a Right to
repeat them."</p>

<p>"An accused Party has always a Right
to have the Charge against him substantiated.
You are silent?&mdash;Well, Mrs.
<i>Patty</i>, since you are so inveterate against
this poor Gentleman, I shall only irritate
you, I am afraid, by acquainting you
with Anything in his Favour, and therefore
I'll keep my News to myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just tell me one Thing&mdash;Has he sent
you back your Poem?"</p>

<p>"My Poem! No&mdash;you know he accidently
burnt that, Months ago."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"You never will believe it," continued
he laughing, "nor forgive him for it.
Why, <i>I</i> have forgiven him, this long
While; and if I have, can't <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>Patty</i>, this Interest in the Fate
of my unlucky Manuscript is, as I have
before told you, very gratifying to me;
but still, I should be more gratified if you
would do Justice to an innocent Man."</p>

<p>"Why, he was here, the Night before
last, Sir! and from the careless Way in
which he inquired for you, I could see
he did not value you a Straw! I really
wonder at you, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>."</p>

<p>"Nay, I must say I wonder at <i>you</i>,
Mrs. <i>Patty</i>; but since we are getting
rather too warm upon it, I'll wish you
Good-bye for the Present, and converse
with you some other Time on what is in
my Mind, but which I fear would just
now meet with an unfavourable Hearing."
Saying which, he took up his Hat,
and was going away quite formally, when,
turning short about, he looked full into
my Face for a Minute, and said with an
inexpressible Sweetness of Reproach:</p>

<p>"Why, <i>Patty</i>! I didn't think you
could be so cross!"</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XX.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Mr. Fenwick's Proceedings.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> his Face before me this Minute!
My <i>Mother</i> was wont to say, "Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>
had smiling Eyes," but I protest
I found they could cut me to the Heart.
I ran up-Stairs as soon as ever he was
gone, and had a good Cry by my own
Bed-side; and wondered what on Earth
could have made me so knaggy and upsettish.</p>

<p>When I went down, <i>Prue</i> was still in
the Shop; and seeing me with red Eyes,
I dare say she thought I had been crying
about Dr. <i>Elwes</i>. I hadn't, however!
There were Customers buying Buns, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
I left her to attend to them, and returned
to the Parlour; and there, who should
there be, sitting at the Window and smelling
to some Primroses, but Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>!
I declare I started as if it had been his
Ghost.</p>

<p>"Well," says he smiling, "I've soon
come back again.... Why, <i>Patty</i>!&mdash;I
do believe you've been shedding Tears!"</p>

<p>"What of that, Sir?" said I, ready to
begin again.</p>

<p>"Only this," said he, "that I am very
glad of it, because it seems as if you
were sorry for the little <i>Tiff</i> we had just
now&mdash;And I'm sorry too, and came back
expressly to say so. But perhaps I'm
mistaken, and these Tears were not
about the Tiff, but about Dr. <i>Elwes</i>
... hey, <i>Patty</i>?"</p>

<p>I shook my Head.</p>

<p>"Well then, all's right," said he, taking
my Hand, and drawing me towards the
Window. "I'm sure I regret the old
Gentleman as much as any one can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
expected to do who cared very little
about him; but the Fact is, I was selfishly
preoccupied with a Piece of good
Fortune that had happened to myself,
and which, you see, I could not be
easy till I had made you a Party to.
How is it I care about telling you,
<i>Patty</i>? How is it you were the first
Person whose Sympathy I wanted to
secure? hey?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't tell, Sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I <i>can</i> tell&mdash;If I can't,
I've made a tremendous Blunder, after
a great Deal of Self-Examination.
What do you think of my having been
presented to the Living of St. <i>Margery-under-the-Wall</i>?"</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" exclaimed I,
clasping my Hands with delight&mdash;"Oh,
that <i>is</i> joyful!"</p>

<p>"Four Hundred a Year, clear," said
he, "that's a good Income, is not it?"</p>

<p>"It's <i>Wealth</i>!" said I. "And no
more than you deserve, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew this was how you would
feel," said he, kissing my Hand. "What
makes you cloud over, <i>Patty</i>?"</p>

<p>"I was only thinking, Sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Come, say it out...."</p>

<p>"That this would remove you from
us farther than ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no! A Quarter of a Mile nearer!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean <i>that</i> Sort of Distance,
Sir. But no Matter&mdash;I rejoice in it
with all my Heart, Mr. <i>Fenwick</i>!"</p>

<p>He looked at me earnestly, was going
to say Something, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," said he, after a
Minute's Silence, "that I might marry on
this?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Sir!"</p>

<p>"And could you, <i>Patty</i>, whom I know
so thoroughly and love so heartily, consent
to be the Wife of a City Parson?"</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! there could be only one Moment
in Life like that!&mdash;And yet, have
not I had many happy Moments, Hours,
and Years since? I can't, to this Day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
make out how he ever came to think of
me; when there were <i>Prue</i>, and <i>Gatty</i>,
and doubtless many young Gentlewomen
of his Congregation, to say Nothing of
remote Country Cousins, (for he had no
near Relations,) to whom I could be but
a mere Foil! I could not make it out
then, and I can't make it out now; but
I am quite content to leave the Mystery
unsolved, and decide that Affection settles
all Distinctions, and Marriages are made
in Heaven. I must say I was very thankful
to dear, good Dr. <i>Elwes</i>, when his
Will came to be opened, (which had been
made some Months before his sudden
Death,) to find he had left <i>Prue</i> and me
Five Hundred Pounds each, in the handsomest
Manner, with more Terms of
Praise of our "laudable Conduct in difficult
Circumstances," than I need to
repeat. I say, I was glad of this Legacy,
and of the handsome Way in which it was
left, because it seemed to make me a little
less unworthy of Mr. <i>Fenwick's</i> Regard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
not that it had a Bit of Influence with
him, however, his Offer having been made
and accepted before the Will was opened:
so that Nothing could be more disinterested
than his Behaviour from first to last.</p>

<p>And the Presentation to this Living
came through the Recommendation of
Mr. <i>Caryl</i>!&mdash;accompanied by a very flattering
Letter, saying it was a Piece of
Justice, and that he knew of no Man on
whom his Uncle could have better bestowed
it. A Piece of <i>Justice</i>, I privately
consider it; and a Salve to his own Conscience
for pitifully burning the Poem of
a Man that writ better than himself.
Nothing can destroy that Conviction.
But I keep it quite secret; the only
Secret I have ever kept or will keep
from my Husband, and this only because
I would not lower his Patron's Nephew
in his Estimation.</p>

<p>Certainly the Gift of a good Living was
far more than an Equivalent for the best
Poem that ever was writ; but yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Poets have naturally such an overweening
Opinion of the Importance of their
Productions to the World, and of their
own Mission as Regenerators of Society,
that to them it is an exceeding hard Thing
to lose the Fame and Influence they
believe they deserve; and I question
whether those of 'em that take the highest
Flights (from practical Affairs and common
Sense, that is,) would consider themselves
at all compensated for the Loss of a heavy
Poem by the Gain of a fat Living.</p>

<p>But my Husband hath since appeared in
Print, in a Way that's highly honourable
to himself and gratifying to his Connexions,
without being beholden to any Patron
whatsoever. He has printed a Funeral
Sermon on Mrs. <i>Eusebia Crate</i>, a highly
estimable Member of his Congregation,
which was brought out by Messrs. <i>A.</i> and
<i>B. Thompson</i>, at the Sign of the <i>Bible and
Star, Fleet Street</i>, handsomely bound in
shiny black Leather, with a black Margin
to the Title. This Sermon, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
published by Subscription, brought my
Husband enough to buy a very handsome
Mahogany Bookcase for his Study, and a
Pair of Pulpit Sconces, besides its being
named in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>. And
though Money was not my Husband's
Object, yet, as the Work, it is thought,
may attain to a second Edition, who
knows but hereafter he may be as successful
as Dr. <i>Hugh Blair</i>, who for his last
Volume of Sermons received Six Hundred
Pounds! Though amazing, it must be
true, for they say it in <i>Pater Noster Row</i>!</p>

<p>As for dear <i>Prue</i>, her Legacy was as
acceptable to her as mine to me, for though
<i>Tom</i> conscientiously brings her all his
Earnings and is now Captain of a fine
Merchantman, Sailors are never over-rich;
I think her queer Engagement to him
steadied her a good Deal: it put an End to
the least Approach to Trifling or Flirting,
which she might have indulged in, had
they been less seriously bound to one
another; and my <i>Mother's</i> Contempt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the Contract and "the Bit of red Glass,"
went so to poor <i>Prudence's</i> Heart as to
engender a Degree of Humility and Submissiveness
quite contrary to her previous
Character. With all this, she was deeply
in Love with <i>Tom</i>, and silently, seriously
happy; nor would she, I am convinced,
have been released from her Engagement
for the World. But it took away all Desire
to be otherways placed than where she was,
in the Bosom of her own Family, in the
quiet, steady Performance of domestic
Duties. So that, when I left Home, it
was with the comfortable Conviction,
which I have never seen the least Reason
to alter, that she would supply my Place
to my dear <i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i>, as well as
in the Business. Indeed, since my Husband
married her to <i>Tom</i>, the necessary
Absences of the latter from his Wife have
rendered it very agreeable to all Parties
that <i>Prue's</i> Home should still be in the
<i>Old Chelsea Bun-House</i>. There's an Opposition
House set up now, which has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
little injured the old Business; but, happily,
none of us are so dependent on it as we
once were; and their Buns are accounted
heavy, so that the ancient, steady-going
Customers still resort to</p>

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
